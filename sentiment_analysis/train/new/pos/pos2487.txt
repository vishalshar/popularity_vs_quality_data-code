My husband and I needed a place for our grandson to nap when he came over.  Someplace safe where our little 8 pound dog wouldn't trip over him on the floor or that Tyler wouldn't roll off of (once he begins to roll).  Pack and Plays were a bit expensive and we didn't need all the stuff that came with it.  Along comes this playard.  It's pretty cheap and the reviews were pretty good so we bought it.  With our Amazon Prime we got it in two days.  I cannot tell you how easy it was to set up.  Literally took me two minutes.  With my rotator cuff issue I thought I would need assistance but not at all.  My grandson sleeps like the angel he is in the playard.  Undisturbed.  Another cool little feature is that it has wheels on one end.  When I'm babysitting him and I need to go to the kitchen to cook or whatnot I just lift one end and take him with me.  A smooth ride and he never wakes up.  Very slick.  I love it!!
