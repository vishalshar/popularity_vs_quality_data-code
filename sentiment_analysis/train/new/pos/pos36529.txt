I bought this to use in my spare room for when my grandson comes over. It is the cutest set I have seen in a long time. The price was amazing and you get so much more than any other set comes with. It came with a skirt, sheet, 2 throw pillows, 3 wall quilt squares, comforter, diaper holder, and a hanging toy bag. My daughter saw it and she said that she really liked it and when I told her what all came with it, she was shocked and wanted to know where I got it. The company also sent it really quickly. I will look to this company for all my bedding needs now..
