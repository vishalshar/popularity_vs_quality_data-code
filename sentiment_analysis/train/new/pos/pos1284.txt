I have been looking long and hard for a good quality blanket for my little one who is 5 months. She loves this cozy warmer that I put in her stroller.  I love that the inside lining is quality sheepskin that keeps her cozy warm. The great thing is that I don't have to bundle her up in a coat or jacket now that it is fall. I can just put her in this cozy blanket, zip her up, and off I go. In the winter I will use a jacket and hat, but feel secure that my baby will be cozy warm. This warmer is much better quality than others that I tried. I liked it so much I got these as baby shower gifts for my brother and cousin.
