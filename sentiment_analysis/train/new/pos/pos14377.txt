I always read the reviews before purchasing an item and I almost didn't order this bouncer because of two comments (with awful pictures) that showed the babies with bruised and bloody feet from kicking the control panel. Then I realized that out of 772 comments, only two people reported this issue. The rest of them raved about the bouncer... So I took my chances. I am convinced that they were competitors because I kept an eye on my 3 month olds feet for a couple of weeks and nothing happened. Now she is 4 months old and has been kicking at the thing for a month without a single bruise or scratch on her feet. She LOVES the bouncer and it has been a life saver for me. It is one of the few places that she will relax and sleep in. The fabric is really soft and easy to remove for washing, the bouncer was extremely simple to put together, its inexpensive and so so cute!
