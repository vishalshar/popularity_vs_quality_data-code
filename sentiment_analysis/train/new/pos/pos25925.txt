I love this stroller ( it is my second one)!!! Light weight, easy to push, love the new cup holder, my son loves the freedom harness. The harness is not meant to attach to the back of the seat, so your child can see out better and move more. No problem turning the wheels. I could see you having problems if you were in rocks or off road, but the stroller is not for that use. I would recommend it and have to 2 of my friends.
