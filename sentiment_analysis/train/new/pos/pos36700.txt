This item was given to us during our child's baby shower over 3 years ago. He didn't really use it too much until about 12-18 months but now this giraffe, or GG as my son calls him is his best friend. It helped to keep our son sleeping through the night as when he hears the little rattle in his hand it soothes him back to sleep. We purchased an additional one from amazon once we saw how much he liked him. This way we can wash one and he always will have one handy. Due to the lovie being dropped on the street, floors or restaurants etc it gets rather dirty. If you see you LO stick to this like glue do yourself a favor and buy a 2nd. Somehow in the rain we lost one in transport from the store to the car so we bought another to make sure we always have 2. The newer ones look 100% cleaner but our son can't tell the difference.
