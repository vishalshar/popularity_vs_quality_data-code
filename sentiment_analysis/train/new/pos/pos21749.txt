Fantastic quality. No doubt this swing will hold up for years. The high back is perfect I just wish the seat were deeper. As it is the edge of the seat comes to about mid thigh on my (36lb, 41") 4 yr old, I really wish I could get a seat that meets to the knee. Like the little tykes bucket swings. I'm not sure how comfortable he would be much older or for longer swing time. I'm afraid longer legs may not be as comfy. He has not complained it is just my observations and preference. Overall though it is a really great product and really easy to attach by removing the old swing and poking a hole in the plastic chain cover so we could slip the chains over our swings existing hooks. Easy peasy.
