First off, worth every penny just to get a picture of your baby looking like an adorable gray teddy bear. It's insanely adorable on.I decided to try this swaddle for two reasons:- I'm awful at swaddling manually- weather right now is too hot for traditional swaddles in my opinionI absolutely love this one! I had tried the peanut, halo and summer infant swaddle alternatives and none worked very well for us for one reason or another. All of them required to have the baby's arms down, but were not tight enough to keep them that way so he ended up struggling to get his arms close to his face (and in the case of Halo ended up struggling so much that the fabric ended up covering his face!!!).With this one there was no struggle. He was perfectly content as I zipped it up because he naturally sleeps with his arms in that position if I leave him unswaddled. He can still move his arms and touch his face and mouth if he wants to, but the fabric provides enough resistance that he doesn't smack himself when he's asleep and wakes himself up. The fabric is very very soft and doesn't feel hot.Recommend it 100%!
