This is a great product.... My son loved it until it died. The base did not seem to charge the little Dino properly. We had it for 6 months before it died and the warranty was for 90 days only. I am ordering another one in hopes it lasts longer because it really is a great light.Subsequent Notes > Before I ordered another one, I contacted the maker of the product (Blue Moon Lites) and explained my problem. They gave me some trouble shooting tips (there is a pin sized hole on the bottom of the light that is a reset button - I used a paperclip to access it. Resetting the Dino for me did not work). After that failed, they asked for the model number and my amazon purchase order.  The person then sent me a new Dino light and asked me to return the faulty one. The representative was so helpful and showed that there are still companies out there that are willing to stand behind their products.Also - that same representative suggested that, in the future, I let the Dino fully discharge about every other week. That will help preserve the battery.All and all - great light made by a great company. I have just purchase a little teddy bear light for the daughter we are expecting in about a month :) So now our house has three of these lights (a Dino, a Elephant, and a Teddy Bear). All cute and child friendly.
