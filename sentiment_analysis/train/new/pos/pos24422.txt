The quality of this item is amazing and the price isn't bad either!! My son is 1 year old and he loves to get it for naps, play, or just simply so I can get things done! The mattress is thick and super soft! It is made of very durable metal and nice fabric that is super easy to clean! On the downside it is a bit heavy and not something you would probably want to pack a long way but they included a nice bag for it that makes it a little easier to bring along! We absolutely love it! :-)
