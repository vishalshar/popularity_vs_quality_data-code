I would definitely recommend this product.  It arrived on time and in good condition. It's not easy to see from the photo, but the finish is a distressed brown paint. It goes very well with the decor in my bedroom.  I bought it because we purchased a new home that is quite dark at night in the winter as the sun goes down very early.  I go to sleep earlier than my husband and he is now able to see just fine when he comes into the bedroom and he doesn't have to turn on the overhead lights or any lamps to get undressed.  It lights the way to the master bath very well.  I would encourage others to place it away from your line of sight when you are in bed as it is a little bright if you can see it when you are trying to go to sleep.  Overall, a good product.  I love the outdoors and feel it adds a nice design element to our bedroom
