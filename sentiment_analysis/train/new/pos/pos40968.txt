Loving our SnugaMonkey. We use it for day time naps with our munchkin and she sleeps really well in the Monkey (as we affectionately call it). I don't think I'd feel comfortable using it as something for her to sleep in overnight because her chin kind of falls forward when she's in it and I'd be afraid of her windpipe potentially being obstructer overnight. We use a bassinet for when she sleeps at night. However the Monkey is a great daytime option when we're awake and can monitor her.  Its perfect for newborns who crave that feeling of being back in the womb as the sides of the rock n'play hug the baby and provide that comfort they seek. Also the angle is great for baby's who have any reflux. Our baby doesn't really spit up a lot after she feeds but this has definitely helped her to spit up even less and we don't have to wait as long after a feed to set her down. The rocking functionality is nice but for us hasn't been as crucial so I'm really happy I went for this version of the product and not the deluxe one that has the auto-rocking mechanism that costs more. Sometimes if our baby squirms in her sleep her own movement will cause the rock n'play to rock slightly on it's own. Alternatively rocking it manually is not that difficult and for us our baby doesn't need constant rocking to stay asleep so we don't really use it as much for it's rocking functionality. Finally, this is just a great and safe place to set our newborn down for a few minutes while we run to the bathroom, or get up to warm some milk etc. It's very lightweight so it's very portable and easy to move around from room to room. It has been a lifesaver for us these first few weeks.
