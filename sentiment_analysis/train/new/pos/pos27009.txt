I was a little skeptical when ordering these because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I went with my instinct and got them. My baby's nursery currently has all cherry furniture with green/pink decorations and I wanted something that would make it pop so we decided to get white wicker baskets that would fit on her changing table and make it stand out. I was a bit concerned about the "sticky and smelly paint" that a few reviews mentioned but fortunately/lucky for us, mine did not have that problem. Mine came packaged nicely with no broken pieces and as white as can be and without any messy sticky/smelly paint. The sizes are perfect to put diapers, wipes, lotions or whatever you need at hand for baby and all three fit on the same shelf. (I've uploaded a pic) I think I may eventually decide to change the liners but for now we're going to use the ones that came with it.
