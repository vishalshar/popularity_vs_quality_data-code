I think I bought 3 other shopping cart covers before finally breaking down and spending the money on this one. I thought it was way over priced for what it was and as a single parent on a budget I wanted a cheaper option. After wasting my money on other brands I have to say I wish I had just gotten this in the first place.This cover is VERY easy to use and my son loves sitting in it (7 months old). You can set it up with one hand while you hold baby and it looks nice too. It's very cushy (yes that's a word) and has lots of room to store your stuff and baby's stuff. I use links to connect my son's toys to the cover so he can't throw them on the floor (this is also a big plus). The pillow that it comes with also attaches to the cover to keep it from falling to the floor. Since my son is a new sitter I use this to kind of prop him up with the pillow on his lap.This cover also has spaces for bottles, diapers, wipes, your wallet and keys. As I said, it's awesome.I would recommend this to anyone, even at full price. If you can find a used one or one on sale that would be even better, just don't waste time on others like I did. But this one, now, you won't regret it.
