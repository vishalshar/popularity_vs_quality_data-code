I really like this small and soft tigger blanket, and I'm sure the little one with love it too. I have noticed that other reviewers have commented that you cannot wash it, because indeed this is what the label says, but after I have read a review where the woman had actually washed the blanket and nothing happened to it, I had decided to wash it right away once i got it. I washed it and dried it and it's still my perfect tigger blanket! NO worries about washing it and giving it to you baby clean! I think manufacturers in most cases overeact when they tell you an item cannot be washed.
