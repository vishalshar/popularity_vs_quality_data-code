i just received this item in the mail today. it is extra soft and comfortable, but too bad it didn't fit my bassinet :: The First Years Carry Me Near 5 In 1 Bassinet. this fitted bassinet mattress sheet is designed to fit ONLY regular rectangular shape pads, not oval pads. what a shame! so i contacted American Baby Company directly to inquire if they carry any fitted bassinet sheets for oval pads... and the answer is: no. =(too bad, i love it sooooo much!this is made in China
