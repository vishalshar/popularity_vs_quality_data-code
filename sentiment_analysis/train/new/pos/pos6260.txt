This is an excellent product.  I am exclusively pumping (long story - daughter won't latch - lost more than 10% in hospital and had to suppliment with expressed milk in bottle - classic case of nipple confusion).  This product has been a life saver.  It goes on easily cold or warm (unlike lanolin which needs to be warm to apply).  The delivery method is great - like a giant chapstick tube - your fingers don't get greasy at all.  It also doesn't hurt when it glides over very sensitive, very painful (cracks / wounds / sores).  My only complaint is that since it is not lanolin based, it doesn't keep your nipples moisturized for long periods of time which could allow cracks, etc. to scab over...however, I found that lanolin kept my nipple too moisturized which led to never healing nipples.  I also had an allergy to lanolin after 2-3 months of use and have since been using this exclusively.  Don't know what I would do without it.
