really like the house when she saw it in the store. I know that people say it is overpriced. of course it is. all of the Vulli stuff is, but my daughter loves sophie and she loves the house. It is easy to clean and to take with you since it is small. Only complaint to Amazon is that the one we got in the mail was in a box that looked like it had been through war. Even poor Sophie had a dirty nose because the box was so broken down. The lid was taped but the tape had been cut and the plastic portion on the top was torn off. This did not happen during shipping because the box was inside of another larger box with other items and that big box was in perfect condition. So...they sent it to me this way. Not my idea of a new item! Especially when it was intended to be wrapped for Christmas. I don't want to have to go through the hassle of sending it back for a new box and a clean nose on the giraffe. So, i decided to just give it to her early and not wrap it.
