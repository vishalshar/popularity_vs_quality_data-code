My husband is a sceptic- and really I am too- but after wearing this necklace for a month, one day my five month old little one was super fussy- not typical for her. Well, while feeding her that day, I spied *two* teeth that she had popped through with little to no previous fussing- and after that one day went back to being her amazingly calm and happy self. Now, whether she is just an easy teether or this necklace helped, who knows, but I'm sure as heck not taking it off!!!I have not tested the products safety- by pulling on the clasp/breaking it (No way!) but the beads are individually knotted and the clasp is the kind that will slip free with pressure- although I hope to never test that.When people ask, I tend to deflect their "wtheck is she thinking" looks by just telling them that it is for pretties and if it happens to make her in less pain, then great. And it is super pretty! This is a great color for anything a little girl might wear- a very classic color that I'm sure will never look bad as she gets older. Actually, I would love one in a longer length for me!!!My only complaint is that it is a bit too long- she lays on it when she sleeps (on her back!). And I think that it would be incredibly uncomfortable- it leaves faint "bead marks" on her back when she wakes up. That will change as she gets older I'm sure- and also my little girl is on the small side of normal and a chubbier baby's chubby chins might prevent that. :) Also, to keep that from happening, I did try taking it off of her when she was sleeping, but I kept forgetting to put it back on. She doesn't seem to mind, so I guess I shouldn't mind either.Overall, I would definitely recommend this amber necklace.
