I'm not sure why the other reviews complained of the shelf ends coming loose. We've had heavy use out of ours for over a year now with no problems. It's loaded down with books and still turns smoothly. The kids LOVE it! It fits a TON of books. The finish has held up very well and matches well with our other furniture. Our play space is right next to the dining room so we're very grateful to have a bookshelf that doesn't look cheap and fits right in when compared with other kid bookshelves. I found it easy to assemble.
