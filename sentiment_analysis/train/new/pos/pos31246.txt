we have older bi fold doors and limited storage space so I'd like my kids to stay out of their closets. I have tried other locks in the past and they never held up to my kids....I looked up the reviews on these locks and decided to give them a try. I was worried that they might not fit due to my older doors being a little thicker then the newer ones. I was surprised on how thick they were when I got them in, they were really heavy duty feeling. And they fit my doors very nicely. I love the fact that I can add the handle to slide it to lock/unlock and then stow it away in the little lip so my kids cant reach it when they get on a chair.... They have survived my kids and all the attempts to get into the closets. We have been thru a couple door knobs but the locks have stayed right in place and the chirstmas gifts and other things that we have stored are safe and sound. my kids are 3,5,7
