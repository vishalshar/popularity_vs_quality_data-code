Sassy Stim Gym mat is priced well. It is bright, and is perfect for belly-time.* Keep in mind that almost all new fabric on children's products from Fisher Price to Carter to Sassy is a combination of PAPER and plastic mixed, like the reusable grocery bags and marathon jackets. If you know this you will not be disappointed. I am sure that this gym will last our child until he outgrows it but it is not a pass down to the next child. The fabric will snag and the paper-fabric mix just wears out. That being said, it is super light weight and packs up small. You can unplug one side of the poke-a-doted arch and attach the mirror. I sewed a small Velcro strap from the bottom of the lady bug side of the pad so that it could be stored by folding it upright. (It stands like a taco) The strap holds the two sides of the gym together at the top, and this allows for easy storage in open sight.My 3 month old son likes hear the bugs rattle and without intentional motor control his arms are still able to whop the rattles. The sizing and design is delightfully designed around a baby not what would appear to just sell to an adult. The proportions fit!PLUS Amazon is about $20 less that the local Village Maternity Shop!Cheers
