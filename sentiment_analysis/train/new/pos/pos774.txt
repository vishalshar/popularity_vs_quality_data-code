This is my second set of this monitor.  The first one served us well for 2.5 years until my genius cat chewed thru the wire.  I liked it enough to purchase it again when the other one was destroyed.  There is some white noise from the parent unit but not nearly as bad as some of the other monitors I tried.  It's simple and it works well.  The parent unit battery charge lasts for a while and it has decent range.  I like that it's a rechargeable battery and I don't have keep buying batteries.
