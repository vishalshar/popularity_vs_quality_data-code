My son slept in this bassinet until 4 month (until he moved into his own room.)Pros --Light-weight, yet sturdy.  This bassinet appealed to us b/c of the sturdy-looking design.  It needed to withstand the strong tail of our black lab, which it did perfectly.  it also moved easily across our hardwood floors.Cons --i was not satisfied with the "mattress" that came with it.  Too flimsy - and the sheet was ill-fitting.  Went to Babies r Us and procured a bassinet mattress ($30).  It fit perfectly and worked much better.
