I can't say enough good things about this car seat. It's highly rated for safety and my 2 week old son seems to be quite comfortable in this seat.I like the brushed cotton feel of the headrest. Contrary to others, this material has not caused any problems for my son (others have said it caused their baby to sweat). Also unlike other reviewers I've had no issues with the handle of the car seat sticking and I love the triangle shape of the handle itself. It's very comfortable no matter how you hold the car seat and it's well padded to make it easy on your hands. This seat also seems to be more lightweight than other seats (we've owned Graco infant car seats in the past and I highly recommend Baby Trend over Graco). The straps on this seat are far easier to adjust than on other brands of car seats and I really like the key-fit style buckle on the harness. If space is an issue with your vehicle this seat, even when fitted into the base, is quite narrow compared to Graco but there is still plenty of room for baby.If you buy this car seat and foresee buying a lightweight frame stroller once baby no longer needs the infant seat (yes, travel systems are pretty and popular but trust me - the strollers weigh a ton and you'll get sick of hauling it around!) the snap-and-go stroller for this car seat is a wonderful option. It's extremely portable and lightweight.
