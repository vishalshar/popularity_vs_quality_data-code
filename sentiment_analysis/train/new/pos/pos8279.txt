We LOVE our Charlie Bananas, ever since the first batch we got.We started on the smalls, then one size, then medium and large.The diapers come with 12 inserts, and 6 covers. Don't go into this thinking that you will be able to reuse covers after they are peed or pood on. Having two or three packs is the realistic choice if you don't want to drive yourself crazy with hand washing! Although the material remains somewhat dry, it still smells and or is stained which would increase the risk of a rash.Speaking of diaper rash-- the diapers have kept our baby's bum rash free for 9 months.The diapers don't "wear out" the colors/material stays bright and we often get compliments on how cool they are. We agree, they rock.Our only complaint is that the one size fits all isn't really "one size" after 7 months we had to switch to the mediums, which are larger, thicker, longer and more absorbant.Overall great product. Definitely recommend to others.
