I was looking for a really nice teething necklace for my good friend, a first time mom.  I looked at a lot of them but this one not only looked like a piece of jewelry she (or I) would actually wear, but it came in "her" colors.  When the necklace arrived, it was so gorgeous to look at and the texture so tempting, I actually had second thoughts about giving it away (and no, not for my child, for myself), it's that nice.I would recommend teething necklaces for all mothers and this one highest of all.
