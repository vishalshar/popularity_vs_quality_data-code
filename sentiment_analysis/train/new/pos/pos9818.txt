This product has proven to be the most useful kitchen tool when it comes to feeding solids to my little daughter!  It's functional and serves its purpose well.  I purchased the Wean Machine when my daughter was 6 months old and been using it everyday since then.  Our favorites are bananas and avocados.  We even take it while we're out and about doing errands...just throw the Wean Machine, banana, & avocado into the diaper bag and voila, I have solids ready for feeding...so convenient!It is without a doubt a MUST HAVE gadget.  I highly recommend this product to all the mothers out there!
