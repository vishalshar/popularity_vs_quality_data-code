I would like to take a moment to praise Tommee Tippee.I have a recently 2-month old baby girland I  breastfeed most of the time, so at times when I am work and she has to eat from a bottle, I want to be confident that she is eating and not wearing her food. Pumping enough to keep up with her is a challenge already so it can be heartbreaking to say the least when she spills the milk.This brand of bottle is in fact the ONLY bottle my daughter can drink her milk without any complications. We tried Playtex Ventaire and with that and other bottles, my daughter ends up wearing half of her milk and it's just a big mess. For nipples, I prefer the variable flow; it seems to be the best for my daughter as well.After trying several different brands that claim to be close to natural nipple, I am glad that there is at least one product out there that rings true.
