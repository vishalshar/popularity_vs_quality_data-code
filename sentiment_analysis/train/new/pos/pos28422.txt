This is a great transitional cup and it has a great no-spill design. Of course, it's still possible to spill, but baby has to pinch the mouthpiece while the cup is inverted for it to spill, and even then it just drips. We really like this cup and our child took to it quickly. The sturdy handholds are also a plus.I would have given this review 5 stars if it weren't for the flip-down cover on the cup, which is a nuisance and makes it really hard for babies to actually use the cup without it flipping down and getting in the way. My advice? Rip off the cover and forget about it.
