Forget swaddling.  Manufacturers should market these as summer toddler throws. This is exactly what I was looking for my grandson's port-a-crib.  Apparently you cannot find just a flat sheet for a baby bed or a crib. I don't know why because I think there's a great market for this in the summertime. My two-year-old grandson likes to have just a little bit of cover on him when he sleeps. This is very light-weight cotton and it gets softer every time I wash it.  The size is perfect.  Not too small and doesnt swallow him either.  So glad I found this.  Will be buying these as gifts.  Heavy blankets or afghans are easy to find...it's the warm weather that I've been trying to find a solution for.
