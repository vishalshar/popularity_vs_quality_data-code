I confess I bought this purely on looks, but it turns out to be pretty handy. The girls like it better than their snugabunny, but not as much as their Bjorn bouncer. Still, they really like the lights on the arm and they will sit for at least ten minutes without fuss, which with twin 3-month-olds is a big deal. I added another more stimulating toy to the bird, which really improved the entertainment value. The music is insanely annoying, but apparently par for the course with this sort of gizmo, not unique to Chicco's fine products. I like the mp3 hook up, though the sound quality is poor. The seat seems comfy and the girls don't slide down in it even if I don't use the harness. I took off a star because, as the other reviewer wrote, the arm is higgly-piggly. It seems quite stable, but it's unnervingly wobbly. I don't worry about it enough to return the rocker. Also, if you have carpet this rocker barely moves. I keep it on the wood floor and it's fine. Overall, especially if looks matter to you, this is a worthwhile rocker.
