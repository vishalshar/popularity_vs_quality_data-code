Probably my favorite all time Amazon purchase!!! And I have prime so I buy a lot as you primer holders know. We take it everywhere. Got it a few months ago have gotten endless use out if already. Now 16 months and great little eater our baby know when this goes up at the resturant if eating time! Great for the independent eater that like to toss plates. We put the food prices straight on here and let her eat on her own. It's awesome, before This it was not very enjoyable eating out having to feed her so she wouldn't toss dishes around.
