Awesome color! (I got the pink one) Lots of compliments when I opened the box at work!! The price for this chair was unbelievable! Most chairs like this go for $100+!! Seems very sturdy and I think my daughter will love it!!! We'll see on Christmas Day! So happy to of found this :)**Ok I've had this now for over a year and it's been great. However, if you get the pink one or any light color I would recommend protecting the chair some way. I don't know what got on my daughters chair... But it is horrible. She My husband and I have scrubbed it so many times with different products hoping to make it look better, but to no avail :( Kids are messy, that's a given. Just keep that in mind when picking the color!
