MAM pacifiers are great!  The nipple has a flatter shape, which is a bit more like what a breast nipple is shaped like during breastfeeding.  They attach to a variety of MAM pacifier clips that are available here on amazon.  Note, the photo is of another Pacifier with the same shape, it's not the same design on the front (my baby's favorite one, actually).  I would recommend these pacifiers to any new mom who needs them to calm their fussy baby.
