Let me just start off by saying that this thing is small! I thought that when I was buying this product it would be at least the size of a coke can and bulky. But decided to purchase it anyway because I have my first baby girl and have "Mommy Brain" as it is. This thing is really a nice product to own I am already loving it and have had it for a year now.The timers and clock are easy to use and the "flashlight" option is nice as well. It has a lock so the timers don't actually get reset when you take it with you in a diaper bag. Small, light, and compact so it's easy to travel with. Clip on the back is sturdy and no screwdriver is necessary to change the batteries.The Breastfeeding slide is very sturdy and stays put when you slide it to the L for left and R for right. We just moved to a new state when my daughter was 1-month-old and my husband had a lot of business trips, so it was really hard for me to remember when I fed my daughter or when I pumped. At first, I tried to write it down on a whiteboard, but this was so inconvenient.Love that it has a clock as well as the timers. It can be set to beep at the timers alert or it can just light it up. It does take 3 "AAA" batteries, I do not recommend getting rechargeable ones because the regular ones will serve you for a long time.
