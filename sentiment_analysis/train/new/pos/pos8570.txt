I had bought a "Lightening McQueen" cup just like this for my 5 year old, and my 3 year old had to have one too. I actually really like this one. It easily clamps down, so little hands can open and shut it, but does not open too easily for it to spill. My five year old is very protective of his cup, and calls it his "school cup." No one else can use it, and it is only for him at school. It has a detachable straw on the inside. So, you can use it by tipping it back to drink, or connect the straw to hold it upright to drink. And NO SPILLING. Not too bad to clean either.
