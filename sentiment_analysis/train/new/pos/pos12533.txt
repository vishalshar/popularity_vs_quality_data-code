I don't have experience with other brands, but this product has worked well in the 4.5 months I've been BFing.  I don't have an issue with the neck line collapsing, although I do tie the neck strap because I've found it doesn't stay in the position I adjust it to.  I like that the fabric is light weight (not so thin that you can see through it, but not heavy) and it covers my chest as long as baby isn't wiggling too much.  Now that she's getting larger and squirmy though, I'm not sure how long it'll cover us...
