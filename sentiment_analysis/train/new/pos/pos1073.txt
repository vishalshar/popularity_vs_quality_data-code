For the price, I admit I was not expecting too much. Toddler sized bedding seems to be tough to find which is a shame considering I wasn't ready to go out and purchase a twin sized bed for my toddler just yet. As inexpensive as this was for a four piece set I did not have high expectations but was so pleasantly surprised.The colors on this set are vibrant. No loose threads and they're soft a smooth to the touch. They are a nice weight, not too heavy or too light. On top of all of this, the cartoon characters from Finding Nemo are delightful and the pillowcase is double sided!!! My kiddo LOVES choosing which one she wants facing up each night.Multiple washes and it still looks BRAND new out of the package. Super nice. And the kiddo is SUPER happy.
