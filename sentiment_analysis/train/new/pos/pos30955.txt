Amazon tells me I bought this October 2014 and I am finally writing a review on July 2015. When I bought these, my daughter was around 2.5 years old. Now she is over three. We use these cups daily. And I mean DAILY. I uploaded a video of the only clean and dry cup we have right now as I write this review (one has water, the other one's straw and cap are drying in the drying rack and the cup itself is in the top dishwasher rack). I have indeed put all the parts in the dishwasher many times, but we moved and our new dishwasher is a lot more basic than our old one and the straw and cap will melt if they get knocked over (I know this from other cups of the same brand - and that is expected as this is plastic after all).My daughter chewed on the straw very early on and I didn't think the cups would really last all that long. But obviously they have. It is not a 100% leak proof cup. They seal the liquids well enough that if a chid knocks it (and you notice), the amount you have to clean up is not very much. The only thing I usually give her without monitoring is a water cup. So it isn't a big deal to clean up water if I later find the cup under the couch with a little puddle around it. This however doesn't happen often. While my daughter is fine drinking from a regular big kid cup, I prefer to not have to be paranoid about cleaning spills on a regular basis as glasses get knocked over amazingly quickly in the middle of dinner. I think these cups are remarkably durable. Plus, of course, the princesses are a big plus with little girls who love them.
