this kit was simple to use! the drop cloth was so big I was able to cute it in half and cover the floor, counter, and cabinets in my bathroom.. i did the cast on myself so it was a bit tricky, but i made it work.. i have plenty of material left..  once my original cast is dry and the wrinkles are sanded (because i casted myself with no help there were wrinkles) I will use the extra to reinforce weak spots and smooth everything out..This was a fun little project to keep myself busy at 40 weeks pregnant! it took about 2 hours from set up to clean up.. I would say 30 minute set up, 45min-1 hour was spent actually casting; and 30-45 minutes cleaning up and showering off all that vaseline.. get all your strips cut before you start.. i did 6", 12", and 18" strips and cut some in half long ways to be thinner.. I also had scissors right there so i could cut smaller pieces toward the end as i put on the finishing touches..
