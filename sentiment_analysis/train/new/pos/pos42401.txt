This stroller is the workhorse in my family. Although I have two toddlers, I find myself using this more often than my dual stroller. The weight, size, maneuverability, ergonomics, and features makes this a very well balanced product. Easy to open and collapse, easy to push around, and easy to carry. A very practical stroller that doesn't take up a lot of trunk space but features most of the bells and whistles of a bigger stroller. In no means is the stroller perfect, but it satisfies most needs in a lightweight package. The only thing lacking in this stroller is storage and maybe the seat belt (could be longer). Other than that, no complaints!
