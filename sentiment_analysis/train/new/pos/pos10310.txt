The crib went together very easily and seems to be quite sturdy. After reading other reviews I meticulously went over every piece looking for dings and scratches. Only one small ding on one piece. Barely noticable and i couldn't even tell you where it is now that the crib is together. I would recommend doing your research on finding the proper conversion rails; for any convertible crib. Amazon recommended the 4799 conversion rails and it showed that most people bought those along with their rowan crib purchase. When you recieve the crib the instuction manual says that you need kit 5789 in order to convert to the full size bed. I looked it up on the DaVinci website and they too recommend kit 5789. I called amazon and they were very helpful. They arranged a return pick up for the 4799 kit that i had ordered. I did not want to risk opening the kit to try the 4799 rails, nor did i want to take the crib apart to test them. It'll be a couple years before we even convert to the bed, therefore i'd rather be safe than sorry and just reorder the correct rails based on the instruction manual.
