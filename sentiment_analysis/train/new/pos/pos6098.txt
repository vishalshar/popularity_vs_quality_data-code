After looking high and low for a crib set that both my husband and I liked, we found this set and I had read the reviews and they were like 50/50 so we decided that the price was so great we had to buy it. Oh. My. Gosh. It is amazing! The colors really pop, the fabric is soft and super comfy and the quality is WAY better than I thought. The picture doesn't do it justice, I am so happy we bought this set for our first son. The only thing I don't like is that the bumper is all one piece..but that's very minor pet peeve haha. So happy with our purchase!
