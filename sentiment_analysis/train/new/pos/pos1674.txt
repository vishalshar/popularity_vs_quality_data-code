This bath toy bag is a great size -- it holds all our toys with a little room to spare. Any more toys and they wouldn't all fit in the bathtub anyway. The netting is plenty sturdy, and allows plenty of air to get to the toys to let them dry out (as opposed to a tight mesh).My only issue is the suction. It does pretty well. But there are plenty of times one side or the other will pop off or slowly slip down the tile wall. So it's not perfect. But I can't imagine other suction options being much better. All in all, I'd buy it again!
