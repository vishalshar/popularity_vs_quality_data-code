The temp. feature is great to have. The night light can be handy at times. The battery life on the base is poor but good on the receiver, I tend to use the power cord usually. I get a slight buzz at about 20ft at full vol. but anything past 40ft is noisy. The indicator lights are handy if I am watching TV. Overall I am happy with the unit. I do recommend getting the one with 2 receivers, one for the bedroom and one for the family room, that way you can just leave them plugged in and not have to worry about batteries
