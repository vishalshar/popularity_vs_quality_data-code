This is a great lamp. It's super cute and not what I expected. The base is fairly heavy which is nice, so I don't have to worry about me (or my kids) accidentally bumping the table it's on and having the whole lamp fall over. With the suggested 40 watt bulb the brightness is perfect, and the shade has nice detail when lit up. The color is nice, and the flowers on the base are not flat, but raised which is a nice touch. The one thing I wish was a little different is the on/off switch. It's a rod that just slides side-to-side and the click it makes when it is being turned on/off is a little louder than I like, but my 5 week-old seems to sleep through it fine. I would recommend this lamp for sure.
