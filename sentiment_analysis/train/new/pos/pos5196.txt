Exchanged emails with Seventh Generation Customer Service back in the Spring when this product was discontinued. They were very friendly and helpful, and let me know the product would be available again around Labor Day as a result of customer feedback. Lo and behold - we got our first box of wipes right before Labor Day! Big Thank You to Seventh Generation for bringing this product back!As for the wipes - we're 3 years in to purchasing boxes of wipes for our family, and these are by far the best we've found. The last 6 months of using various other wipes has simply served to reconfirm that. Best combination of moisture without leaving residue, size, cleaning power, price, environmental credentials and lack of nasty chemicals. In case you can't tell, we love 'em!!
