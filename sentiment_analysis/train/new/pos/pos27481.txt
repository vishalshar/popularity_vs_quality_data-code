I have purchased this tent four times for my grandchildren.  Each time one of my children begins their family, I purchase this for our summer outings and beach vacations.  It is so easy to assemble, NO poles to feed into the nylon tent.  Just pull the cord on top of the tent and its up in place.  It even has pockets on the outside to fill with sand to keep the wind from blowing over.  It is perfect for a infant and up to 3-4 year old child to take a nap or just play out of the sun.  The front netting zips closed to keep away bugs. To collapse, the quick release pull of the cord again releases the tent which then folds in half and stores in a carry bag.  It is lightweight and so simple to use.  Best accessory purchase - great baby shower gift too!
