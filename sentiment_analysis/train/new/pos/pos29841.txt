I bought a whole bunch of toddler-sized utensils for learning purposes. These are the favorite so far.- size: people complain they're small, but let me tell you... my toddler can get a huge, messy bite onto this spoon and, slowly but surely, is successfully getting that bite to her mouth. The spoon is shallow, but we're still working mostly with foods that stick to the spoon a little, like yogurt, applesauce and the like.- safety: she can explore fork function without any risk of actually stabbing things or herself. Mostly she places bits of fruit onto the fork part.- bendability: these not only bend left/right but up/down so they've been great for helping her figure out how to feed herself.- quality/durability: despite the low cost, they're very nicely made and are holding up well. Once she figured out she could bend them herself, there were a few days when the spoon got very abused but it's no worse for wear.She will grow out of them quickly, yes, because they are so small. But for a real beginner set these were worth the money.
