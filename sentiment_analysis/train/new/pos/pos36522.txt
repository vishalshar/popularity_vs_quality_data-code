Best thing I bought for baby. She used it every day from day one and took naps in it or on me exclusively for the first year. It's great on rough terrain, has lots of space underneath, comes with car seat adapter that I never used, and best of all adjusts forward facing or back facing and allows baby to lie down or sit up. It does not lie flat but reclines all the way back so baby is cradled with head and feet a little higher than her bottom like you are holding her. I recommend extra cushioning or blankets for little babies. The seat can be removed with baby sleeping in it if you want to move her with out the stroller. It does take two hands to remove the seat and turn it around. Reattaching it is very easy. Folding is easy. She still loves it now at 22 months old and it is still as good as new. The cup holders for parent are nice. It's easy to take up and down stairs. My only complaint is the brand stickers are cheaply done and are easily damaged when exposed to water. It doesn't affect the stroller at all, of course, but doesn't help the company's advertising. I keep this stroller at home now where we have rough terrain and keep a smaller stroller in the car for going to town.
