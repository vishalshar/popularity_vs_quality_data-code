I loved this tub! I had a c-section and I was in no shape to be bending over a bathtub for a few months.  In any case, I would not have been comfortable putting my newborn in anything but a sink tub - so this was perfect.  With respect to some of the poor reviews I read - it seems they think this tub is supposed to last forever - I only used it for 4 months - then I used a tub (Primo brand) made to go inside of an adult bath tub.  At 4 months, both baby and mom were ready to graduate to the big tub.  Also, I liked that you couldn't submerge the baby in this tub - I would not have felt safe submerging a newborn - one slip and their face could be under water!  That's so dangerous! Plus, I never noticed my son was cold - I kept a washcloth over his torso, making sure the washcloth was warm.  Only his feet and upper torso were not submerged in water.  Finally, the baby stays put because of the skidproof yellow liner.  I felt very in control and it was comfortable bathing him at sink level.  My lower back was killing me the first few months after birth, so like I said, I could not have used anything but a sink tub in the beginning.  Anyway, for a new mom, I was very comfortable using this product - I would have been very nervous with anything else.  This is a great starter tub and costs less than a pizza - I loved this product!!
