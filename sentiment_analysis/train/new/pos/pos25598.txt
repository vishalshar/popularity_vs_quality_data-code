This was one of the most useful baby items I have purchased.  Both of my babies have had acid reflux and need to stay upright after feedings. This sleeper has the right amount of incline, not too steep that they can't sleep and not too low that they would spit up. I also like that the baby's head is against a fabric rather than plastic support, making it comfortable and preventing the risk of flat head syndrome. I would use this thing all over the house to have free hands to get things done and allow the baby to be close to us and observe what's going on. The cover comes off fairly easily for washing and after many washes on delicate cycle it still looks like new.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I have problems getting it to fold up like it's supposed to. The knob that is suppose to turn to unlock got jammed soon after I purchased it, so I end up just carrying it around as is and cannot store it folded up. This is slightly irritating but I would still buy it again knowing this.
