These are seriously the only cups we've found thus far to ACTUALLY be spill proof. They've been thrown, dropped, and left upside down and they never leak. The valve is very easy to clean. I also like that you can mix and match the lid and cup colors. Yes, it's irritating that Gerber, of all companies, wouldn't make a cup that fits into standard cup holders, but considering I don't have to follow my toddler around and soak up puddles left everywhere he takes his drink, I'm willing to overlook that inconvenience.
