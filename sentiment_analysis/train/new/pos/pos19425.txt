This has saved my life. My daughter has a sneaky craft habit of constantly losing her pacifiers. These are cheap enough to buy a few without feeling the pain (they are way more at BRU or any other store) and they last. You can wash them in the washer. They do a great job of keeping a handle of the pacifiers. Way cheaper than constantly replacing pacifiers! :-)
