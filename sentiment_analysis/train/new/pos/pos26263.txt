I read lots of reviews before picking this mattress. I wanted GreenGuard and Certipur, plus organic cover. I read about the various foam products for foam mattresses and in my opinion, soy added mattresses are a marketing hype more than anything. The percent of soy doesn't have to be declared and there's no information or regulation regarding this. I found another kind of foam, food grade polyurethane, that sounds interested but was only able to find a couple of mattresses using it. They didn't have the other features I wanted and were crossed of the list. Our other kids mattress is innerspring coil and weighs a ton, so I wanted light weight. After evaluating many brands and models, I ended up with this one. As other reviews said, it's very firm. However, most of the reviews for mattresses that were softer mentioned sagging after a certain period of time. I'd rather start firm and not have sagging. Our boys slept on cosleeper "mattresses" which are essentially very firm cardboard, so these weren't too different for them. Based on other reviews, I was concerned about receiving a legitimate product. The cardboard insert showed a different cotton cover and the tag didn't mention anything organic. I called the company and she told me what to look for on the tag. She also said they changed the cover but didn't update the marketing insert so it would look different. She said the company is aware of this confusion on Amazon. Why they haven't corrected it, I'm not sure, but both of my mattresses for my twins are legit. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase.
