I got two of these, and I love them. My apartment doesn't have air conditioning, so I was leaving all the windows and interior doors open all summer and fall. The problem was that sometimes a big gust of wind would slam one of the doors shut, which startles anyone who's home and worse, can leave my cat locked out of the room with his litter box! I put one of these on the door to my bedroom and the other on the bathroom door, just over the latch, so he always has access to food and water, too. That way, the door can be 99% of the way closed for privacy, but the cat can still get in and out. When I want to close the door, I just pop it off and hang it on the doorknob. If I want the door propped wide open, I can stick it between the door and the jam on the hinge side. Easiest doorstop I've ever dealt with, and the clear plastic is nice and unobtrusive.
