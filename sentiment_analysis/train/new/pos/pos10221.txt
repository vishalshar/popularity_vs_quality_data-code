I was extremely hesitant to purchase a glider without sitting on it first, however I found one at Toys R Us that was by the same manufacturer and looked almost the same. After emailing Stork Craft, they confirmed it was the same. I had been looking at this one for some time and was excited it was exactly what I had thought it would be, sitting in it or not. It was super easy to put together with the provided Allen wrench. At first glance, it is beautiful, but after really inspecting it and sitting in it, it is definitely worth more than it is priced at. Although our baby is not here yet, we have sat in it daily, gliding and really trying to break it in. We did buy the 2 year protection, just for peace of mind.. The side pockets are convenient to put the tv remote in & cell phone, so not lost. The lumbar pillow was a nice bonus, although I probably will replace with something else.. One thing I struggled with is knowing exactly how tall the back is, as I am 5'10" and need to lay my head back.... this is great.. It's just high enough to lean back comfortably so I can rest my eyes.. From top of seat cushion to top of back cushion it is 29".In all, I definitely recommend this glider.. Buy the extra $19 protection plan, and you literally can't go wrong.. Also, super quiet!!
