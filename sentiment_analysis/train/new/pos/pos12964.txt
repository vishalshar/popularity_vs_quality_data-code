Bought them with baby #1 and they are like new after 6 months of use for baby #2. I find these more comfortable and breathable than the disposable kind. They are easy to wash with my clothes.Note: The disposable kind achieve "no show" in a way that any washable pad can not. But it's worth it- if they were thin then they wouldn't absorb anything. These are really more comfortable. I use these nightly and at home.Mama's have a crazy supply the first month after a baby is born. Thankfully it regulates after that. During that special time I would nurse and need to change these immediately after the feeding. Sometimes needed two. It worked out ok because I was on maternity leave and the baby created so much laundry that I was washing laundry anyway.
