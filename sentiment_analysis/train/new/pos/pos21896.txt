I don't understand why people complain about these. Yes they are not easy to install, but they perform their intended job well. I also do not attempt to use the curved portion of the catch to shut the doors without having to depress the latch itself. I prefer to install the latching component at a higher level so that you have to lower the latch when you open and also lower the latch when you close the cabinet or drawer. This way I know that the lock is working as intended. It takes a whole extra .5 seconds which I find very acceptable to know that my child is safe.
