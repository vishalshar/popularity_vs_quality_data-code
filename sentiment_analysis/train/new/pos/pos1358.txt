Here's the deal, seat protectors (or anything touching/attached to your car seat) that are not tested by the company that makes your car seat can invalidate the warranty on your car seat if you're in an accident or if something horrible happens. We learned this when we were having our car seat inspected and the official doing it told us the seat protector we had would invalidate any warranty because the car seat maker no longer guarantees it's effectiveness. The benefit of this seat protector is that Britax actually DID do crash tests with their car seats and their seat protector (many companies don't) and so their warranty is still in effect if you use this. It does provide the coverage on my husband's leather seats so we know it's not being damaged which makes us both happy, and on top of everything else we know our car seat is effective!
