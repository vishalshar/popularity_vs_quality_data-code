I had horrible bleeding and cracking with my son (first baby).  Breastfeeding was so painful.  I used Lanolin, the hydrogel pads, I tried nipple shields, but just toughed it out for the first few weeks.  It was awful.  I found these on Amazon before the birth of my daughter and I have used these with EVERY feeding starting in the hospital.  True, I only use them during the day, because they can leak if you lay flat.  But I religiously use these and wash them every night.  My daughter is 5 weeks old and I have had ZERO bleeding or cracking and the pain has been much better.  The fact that nothing can cause friction against you, breastmilk can just dry on you, and you get oxygen through the holes all help you to heal in between feedings.  I have told all of my pregnant friends about these.  I so wish I knew about these with my first baby.  Aside from a good latch, this is the one thing that I have tried that will help!  P.S.  This is the 2nd Amazon review I have ever written and I use Amazon all the time, I just feel so strongly about these.
