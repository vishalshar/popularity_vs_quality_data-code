I bought the Evenflo SmartSteps Jump N' Go Jumper for my daughter when she was 4 months old. At first she just sat in the jumper and played with the toy in the tray. Now, however, she is 5 months old and she jumps all over the place. She will actually jump so much that she will fall asleep while sitting in the jumper after playing too hard. I have not (and probably would not) place the jumper in a normal-sized doorway, as I have read in other reviews. We use the jumper in an oversized doorway area that is about 8-10 feet wide. Therefore, I have had no problem with the baby hitting her head, hands, or anything else. If your home only has regular sized doorways and you want a jumper for your baby maybe you should think about one that stands alone. The toy in the tray is really cute; it grabs the baby's attention and keeps her busy. It has lights and music and says, "let's jump." The toy is also removable, even though we hardly ever remove it from the tray. The tray toy gave my daughter something fun to do while she was in the learning stage, trying to figure out the whole jumping thing. She still plays with, laughs, and gets excited over the toy even now that she knows how to jump. The jumper is very sturdy and I have not seen anything that would make me think it is not safe. I consider it to be very safe and am so glad that I made this purchase for my little angel.
