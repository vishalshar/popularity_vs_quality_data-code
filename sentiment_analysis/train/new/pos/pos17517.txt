I bought these when my son wasn't even born yet, he is now 14 months and I use them occasionally when he is sick.  These were a LIFESAVER when he was a newborn though.  Seems like everyone has their "diaper blow out" horror story, but with these I had to take more time to clean up my son than switch the sheets.  I bought two and rotated them.  The thing I loved most is the easy clean up because my son had acid reflux the first few months.No issues, did it's job, and still going strong after 14 months and being switched out and laundered every couple days.  Great product and a definite recommendation for any mom!
