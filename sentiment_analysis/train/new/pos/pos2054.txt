We've been using this for almost 3 years now.Pros:The fabric is great and it's a very comfortable seat.Still looks brand newHas grown well with my larger than average childFits wellThe "air" sides make great head rests for napping in the carCons:The straps cut into my child's neck and the company doesn't offer any padding.The part to tighten the straps gets caught and is difficult to tighten.My 4 year old is outgrowing the harness well before the weight limit.Overall a good seat... I purchased the infant seat because of this seat and love that as well.
