We purchased the equivalent in pink for our daughter 4 years ago and it worked great. She was able to sit by herself in the chair for short durations while I took a shower, did the dishes or laundry.My daughter didnt care much for the vibration at first, but got used to it and it seemed soothing after a while.I like this option much better than a swing, since I didnt want my kids used to the moving motion (at all times). I wanted them to be able to sleep on their own (still).We purchased this recently for my son, and it has worked great again, provided a bit of relief when needed.The pink bouncer has been handed down to two new nieces and are still in great working condition, so even though very inexpensive, this bouncer just keeps going!!
