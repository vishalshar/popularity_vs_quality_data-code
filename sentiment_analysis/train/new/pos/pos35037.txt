So I normally review tools between my 4 accounts so this review is going to be a little detailed. Bottom line will be my "Overall view".This is slightly larger than the aluminum caribiners you can get at your store, 30% bigger in thickness and maybe 20% in overall lenght and width from a laying down position. It had divets throughout the plastic which I assume was either put there for looks or a failed attempt at structural support.The plastic itself is about the same as an otterbox phone case, abs I cannot attest to since I do not want to break it (it feels like structural foam or comparable now that I think of it), spring on it is comparable to its aluminum counterparts or even possibly stronger. When holding it you can really tell its much lighter than most caribiners, the divets really helped in reducing its weight but at the same time it would have been light anyways and I feel you lost strength when doing that. Weight I would not suggest 20-30lbs but can support flashlights, keys or some lighter bags without scaringe too much. I got the color I chose and the construction was fairly decent for the purposes I had intended.If you are looking for a device to carry any decent amount of weight than keep looking as I can almost guarantee you this will fail. If you just need it for 10lbs and under or need a keychain than this is perfect. I am going to get a couple more myself to put in my bugout kit.
