I really like this. Easy to maneuver one handed and covers up alot. It's like a big blanket, and I'd rather have a big one than a little one. I also really like the curved rigid part at the neck so you can see your baby without having to move or remove the cover. My husband commented that a tall person standing behind you could probably look down into that rigid part but honestly I don't think someone would be standing that close to me from behind while I'm feeding my baby. It would just be creepy, and I would move. My baby doesn't seem to be hot in there, and she usually falls asleep while I have this on and am walking around a store nursing her, and I usually just leave the cover over her/me to keep the light and strangers out of her face.
