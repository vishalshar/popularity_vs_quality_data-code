I like this chair a lot!  As a first time granny I tend to be cautious to a fault.  My main concern was stability and safety. This chair has alleviated both concerns. The 5 straps are easily adjustable with shoulder padding for comfort. My favorite features would be the adjustable heights and reclining back. Also like that you can fold for easy storage when not in use. I base all my online purchases on reviews. They only gave me 5 stars for rating, I would have given this chair 10 stars.
