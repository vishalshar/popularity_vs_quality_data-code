The sippy cup shown is the one I wanted because they are AMAZING. They do not leak and hold 10 oz of fluid. I know this because I ordered these before and received the orange one pictured and a green one just like it for my now 17 m old son. He is very rough with them and they do not leak even with him throwing it around. So I expected to receive them again and just wanted extra to make my life easier but I did NOT receive what is pictured. The only thing similar is that they are the Gerber graduate. They are blue and I am willing to give them a try because they are the same no leak concept but I take off one star because what is pictured is what you should get. It is too easy to take a picture and put up the options for there to be an excuse.
