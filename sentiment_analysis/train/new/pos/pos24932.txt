I am using this to store dirty work out clothes in and it mostly suites my purposes. It definitely contains the odor (and it is bad) and makes it look much tidier/easier to get to the washer. The only problem is the bag won't close all the way. Maybe because there is so much fabric with the XXL? I'm not sure but no matter how I try cinching it or moving the fabric around the cord around I can't get it all the way closed - that being said, the odor is still well contained. But I'm not sure how well this would work for someone wanting to use it for cloth diapers/anything small enough to potentially come out of the hole left open. The hole is about the size of a pair of balled up workout socks.
