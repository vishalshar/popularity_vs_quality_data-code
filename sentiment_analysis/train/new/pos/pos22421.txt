This is the single best towel that I own. This towel is huge, a thick cotton blend, and is rather soft. The only down-side is the frog eyes curl over when washed and I would highly recommend that you WASH THE TOWEL SEPARATELY from any other baby clothes. I made the mistake of washing it with the rest of my daughters clothes and everything was covered in brown lint and so was the little one. After a few washes the lint goes away though.
