We bought this stroller for our 2nd child. With our first we tried many strollers and was not too pleased with any of them. I will start with the cons for this stroller1. extra wide wheel base- Even though this stroller can turn on a dime the wheels in the back make tight squeezes difficult.2. It's heavy. We are only using the car seat attachment right now, but it's already pretty heavy.3. Car seat attachment. Even though we purchased one of the carseats listed that it would fit, ours does not fit exactly right. It fits good enough but we have to use the teather that came with it for added security.Not really huge issues, especially for the price. Now for the pros1. Very smooth. I feel like I am pushing a higher end stroller. The baby never wakes up even though I go over bumps in the ground.2. Huge bottom basket. This stoller has ample space for all of the other baby gear that these little ones seem to need.3. high push bar. Im not tall by any means, and its comfortable for me. My husband seems to like it as well.The parent tray is nice to, and for the price we paid I am more than happy with this purchase.
