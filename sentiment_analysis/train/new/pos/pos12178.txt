My daughter loves Mickey Mouse and eating.  Even though she's 2.5 and knows how to use her spoon/fork, she's such an enthusiastic eater that food generally ends up everywhere.  For a while, she was refusing bibs and we were doing a lot of laundry.  I bought her this and it's Minnie counter part and now she is SO excited for her Mickey/Minnie bibs that putting on a bib is no longer a problem.  These are so easy to wash and cover up so much of my daughter that the amount of laundry and ruined clothes has dramatically decreased.  Great purchase
