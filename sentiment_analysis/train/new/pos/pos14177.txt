These are smaller than I thought they would be, but work very well.  I'm not a fan of lavender scents, but this one is not overpowering, and is actually quite pleasant.  I hope they last 90 days as promised.I got these to try out because my doctor's office doesn't allow us to throw away wet diapers in the exam rooms, but they always want our newborn in a dry diaper.  Since it's a 35 minute drive to their office, she is inevitably wet every time.  So I keep one of these in the diaper bag, and also use the Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Bag Dispenser, Assorted baggies, and I never worry about my diaper bag smelling fowl, even if it's only for a 35 minute drive back home.Added Oct 20:  3 months later, these are STILL fresh.  I haven't replaced any of them in my diaper bags, hamper or diaper pale.  These DEFINITELY last 90 days as promised, and today, they still smell like they did on day 1.  They've helped everything stay fresher.  I will be buying these again, once the first pack finally wears off.
