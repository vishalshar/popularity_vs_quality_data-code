Fantastic stroller for the money! We bought our first Kolcraft Tour Sport stroller in 2009 for our then 2-year-old. We were so happy with it that we bought another in 2011 for our 20-month-old before a month in Europe. We wanted an umbrella stroller that was sturdy enough to survive l-o-n-g walks on cobblestone streets, but also compact and easily foldable for restaurants, into the Metro, up and down winding stairs, and on the interail trains. You can easily carry the stroller with one arm while holding onto your child with the other arm. With 3 kids, we have gone through many strollers (Graco, Chicco, Baby Trend) in the last 9 years -- more expensive, more bells & whistles, more bulky -- and this Kolcraft stroller was one of our best buys. We do have a Bugaboo, and while it would have been more comfortable and maneuverable for our toddler, we sure didn't want to risk it being damaged by the airlines. At $49 (plus free prime shipping from Amazon!) the Kolcraft Tour Sport was a WORKHORSE. Once in a while, the canopy would pop off the stroller frame while we were folding it, but it was easy to pop back on. The kids would fall asleep easily in the stroller and were very comfortable with the seat reclined. Definitely recommend.
