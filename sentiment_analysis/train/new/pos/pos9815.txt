I was very skeptical, but any parent with an early teething baby gets to a point where $20 doesn't seem unreasonable to try out a new fix.  We ordered the bracelet and necklace a week ago and have kept it on  our baby almost all the time.  There has been a difference in the level of drool and how uncomfortable she seems and how often she shoves her fingers and objects to the back of her mouth.  She still sticks her fingers in her mouth once in awhile but not nearly as often.  I was so skeptical that the bracelet was even real amber that I went ahead and did some tests on the amber.  It passed the UV light test and the alcohol test.  She's cut a lateral incisor this week with no problem and is about to cut another molar, but you wouldn't really know unless you looked.  Whereas before, she would be so uncomfortable, fussy, unable to fall back asleep after waking up from pain and drooling uncontrollably. We'll see how she acts as she continues to teeth.
