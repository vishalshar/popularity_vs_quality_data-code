I didn't want to spend $100-$200 for a nursery bedding set and was thrilled when I found this bedding!  Exactly the theme I wanted and at such a great price. It's more adorable in person and the colors are true to the picture.  As another reviewer mentioned, the elephant's ears on the comforter are floppy and an unexpected add-on.  I also purchased the matching bumper and am very pleased with the entire set!  I would definitely buy this again.
