This is, by far, my favorite thermometer to use for my infant and young child. What I like best, is that it gives me a reading quickly, within 5-8 seconds. I also like that it can be used orally, axillary (under the arm), or rectally (we purchased a duplicate one for that type of reading). It also seems to give accurate readings. The red 'fever' indicator light is a plus too. Definitely recommend this thermometer for parents of infants or young children.
