For some time, whenever I saw a glider chair, I had always wanted one.  I was looking at a different model, but decided to change to this model because of the reviews the other and this one received.  I can say, I do agree with the positive reviews for this glider chair.  I had no problem putting it together in less than 30 minutes by looking at the diagrams in the directions.  The cushions on this chair is very soft and comfortable.  I could feel my muscles relaxing as I continued to sit in it.  My mom wanted a glider chair after sitting in mine, but she chose the glider with the curved top.  I put her chair together for her, but had difficulty in finishing it.  The bottom holes to connect the arms of the chair to the base were not drilled all the way.  One of the screws refused to go in all the way.  After completing her chair, I was very glad I purchased the Tuscany Glider and Ottoman.  I felt it was a higher quality chair.  Yes, it did cost a little more than the other one, but I feel it was worth it from experiencing the assembly of both chairs.  The arm cushions also have outer pockets which may be standard in all of the chairs now.  The chair is light enough to move around if needed.  Great chair to sit in reading a good book or watching TV.The only improvement to this item I would have liked is if the ottoman was a bit higher than it is.  It's still a sweet purchase and best of all, no shipping cost having the Prime account.
