This is my second lot of these bibs.  My 2 year old is out of the full body bib stage but still makes a mess with drop and drips.  I discovered these in my local store with my previous child and found them to be excellent coverage width wise for the older child.  The quality isn't spectacular, shame as i'd pay more if the quality was improved.  However if you hand wash these they will remain in tact.  I had the same unfortunate experience as a previous reviewer when I put mine in the washer.  The backing degraded and began to peel away. I only use a non biological liquid and had popped them in a mesh laundry bag.  I haven't washed these new bibs in the machine & I'm not sure I will.  I rinse then well in hot soapy water after each use and then I have been hand washing in laundry liquid once a week. These dry super quick and fold up to nothing so they work wonderfully as take out bibs.
