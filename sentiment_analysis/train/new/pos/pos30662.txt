There are a lot of reviews saying this aspirator is too rigid and hard to squeeze. That almost turned me off from buying it, but then I looked at the dates and saw that those reviews are quite old. I filtered by date and the new reviews were all positive. So I decided to give it a try. I bought it in April 2014 and the aspirator I received is perfectly easy to use! It requires the same amount of squeeze as the regular bulb aspirators that don't have a plug. I don't have to run it under hot water or anything. It's perfectly fine. And I love the fact that you can open it and clean it!!! It also narrows at the tip to prevent over-insertion, which is nice. So, if anybody else is wondering about the conflicting reviews or scared away by the overall 2-star rating of this item, give it a chance - it's unjustly suffering from bad old reviews and a bad older version, but it has since been improved!
