The product is small - about 3 to 4 credit cards or gift cards snug.  Anything more than that would be too much.  The wallet itself feels great.  Although it is too small for the purpose I intended to use it for, I do have an alternate use.  The approximate delivery time frame was middle of May into the first week of June.  I received it more than 10 days ahead so I want to thank the store for the quick response to my order.
