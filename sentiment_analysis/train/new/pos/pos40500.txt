Great gates! After a little bit of labor to get it installed, this gate is awesome for our stairway, which is surprisingly narrow as we have an older house. This gate adjusts to fit your home. Very sturdy when properly installed. Make sure you have a sturdy surface to attach it to. We bought two, one for the top and bottom of the stairs. Would work for other types of openings and doorways as well.
