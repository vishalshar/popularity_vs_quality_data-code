Love that you can use as a sippy cup or medicinal administration too when you have a child who won't take his meds. You can give him this cup all the time and just put the med in when you need to. They will never know when they are getting med or drink. The cup is designed for them to give meds first before they get their drink. Love it. It is a hard nipple cup, so if they can't drink from those yet they have pacifiers that can do it as pell with a smal plunger to plunges the last bit of med me fore the child decides they don't want the binky anymore.
