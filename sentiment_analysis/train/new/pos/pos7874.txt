Finally! I've been searching high and low for silicone sippy spouts that I can use with my (standard-sized) glass bottles! Not only are these affordable, they also completely fit the bill! They work like a charm (we use Evenflo classic glass bottles) and now we can heat/serve milk without worrying about plastics AND our baby can start learning to transition to sippy cups now!UPDATE: Still love it! Works with LifeFactory bottles too and much cheaper than the LifeFactory sippy spout and I love that this one is silicone instead of plastic. Just bought 3 more!
