I really like this crib because it is very sturdy even though it is small. It has a flat board under the mattress and that makes it perfect to use with the Bebe Sounds Movement Monitor (For complete peace of mind when your baby is sleeping).I had a small problem with the mattress and contacted Cosco directly by email. They were very courteous and fixed the problem immediately.My son does get his legs caught between the crib bars (as he would with any crib) and so I have ordered the bumper pads to go inside of the crib. I also bought him a SleepSack blanket sleeper that will zip both of his legs up inside and that should stop the problem.This crib is a great value and I am very pleased with it. I like that my son can still sleep beside my bed, since he has outgrown his bassinet, and that I am able to use my movement monitor with the crib.4/20/03 P.S.- The bumper pads and the SleepSack blanket sleeper have stopped my son's feet from getting caught between the bars.  He is 7 months old (quite active and very tall for his age) and we are still happily using the crib every night.2/11/08  P.P.S. We are still using this crib for my second son who just turned 3 years old.  I love this crib and we have used it for years now!
