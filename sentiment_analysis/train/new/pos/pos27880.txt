We got this one to replace another gate we'd had for 6 months that had always been difficult and suddenly stopped releasing the bottom latch.Installation was pretty painful, but we have an odd setup where we needed to leave some room underneath for our cats to get under, so I blame it partly on that that I had to drill the latch-side holes 3 times to finally line it up right. My best advice is to not tighten *anything* until you've fit the whole thing together and are sure you've got it done right. I expect that for a normal installation it should be pretty easy overall. Also, the eyebolts can unscrew pretty far and still be sturdy, so don't make the mistake I did and try widening the gate beyond where you've measured, you'll just have to undo it and start over the way they originally told you to.The part with the handle feels slightly flimsy but overall it seems to be well-constructed and sturdy. The mechanism to open it is *very* easy and I love that. I'm giving this 4 stars on faith that it will hold up better than the last one (different company/model). I do recommend this one.
