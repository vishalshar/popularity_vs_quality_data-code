I am a busy mother of 2. A 4 year old and a 9 month old. I am kit embarrassed go say that my 4 year old is still into sippy cups. They save my sofa, car and so many spills. Many times it wasn't my preschooler causing spills, it was the cup. Until one day in November 2015 I was shopping at my local bru and they gave my a free cup. A the first year slim cup. I took it home and a few days later used it. I don't usually use this term but  OMG  I love this cup. It's the only cup that doesn't leak that doesn't have nasty inserts to take off, you know the ones that grow mold inside. I quickly started thought away all off the other sippies and went back to bru to look for more. No luck. They were out and they weren't selling them as the we're only for a promotion they were running. That's when I looked online and found it! The cup can be tilted in any position and no leaks. Aldo it doesn't have any extra parts to wash it really is the most perfect cup.
