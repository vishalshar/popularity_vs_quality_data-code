This is seriously one of the most useful things I've ever purchased as a mother. I bought it to go inside of our JuJuBe diaper bag, and it's ended up being the thing I used way more than the diaper bag itself! It's perfect to put 3-4 disposable or two cloth diapers in, a to-go pack of wipes in the hard case, and a couple tubes of butt cream. I'd keep that packed ALWAYS, and throw it in the diaper bag to grab easily when we needed to do a diaper change. Then I started leaving the diaper bag in the stroller outside the restroom, and eventually it became the only thing I brought with me. I like to travel light. I got rid of the diaper bag and just kept it in my purse, and it fit nicely, and was easy to grab on the way out the door. The material has held up perfectly, cleans easily, and there have been NO defects in workmanship at all after over three years of use. I'm excited to buy another one in a new color for baby #2!
