Our 2.5 son did excellent potty training at home but had trouble at school and out in public. He can't quite stand and reach a standard sized toilet. This is a great solution-it travels and cleans easily. My son is on the lighter side (27lbs) and it has held up fine. I typically put it in a disposable grocery bag and carry sanitizing Clorox wipes to clean after each use. He has one at preschool and then one that we take out. My only complaint is that while the rubber grips help-it can sometimes slide a bit when getting him off the seat-wish there was a 'lip' on it. We have some maneuvers down to avoid this. It does the job and has been a savior when out in public and the bathrooms are less than desireable.
