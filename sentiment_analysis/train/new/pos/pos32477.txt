I picked up two of these frames to use as gifts when we announced that we're having a baby.  Our parents (Grandparents to be) loved them.  We thought they were such good frames that we ended up buying another one to keep for ourselves.Inside the frame you'll find multiple messages you can use instead of "coming soon".Others include:- I'm on my way- Sneak peak- It's a boy- It's a girland many others.  I would say there were probably a good 3 dozen messages to choose from, some in other languages like German.
