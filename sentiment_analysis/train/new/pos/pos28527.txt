I've nursed three kids now and I have to say that these are my favorite gel pads ever.  They are soft and cool to the touch and very comfortable against the nipple.  Refrigerated, they are heaven on earth for sore nipples.  They are cool and comforting, and prevent the nipple from getting hard scabs that then get removed as baby nurses -- ouch.  Another plus is that they don't stick to the nipple at all, so removing them is simple and painless.  (For the record -- I have tried other brands that DID stick to the nipple and that was not pleasant, so I highly recommend avoiding that!) Finally, they are thin and not bulky which means that they're not super noticeable when you're dressed.  In summary -- they are a LIFESAVER!  I have made sure to have these on hand at all times and highly recommend them.The only issue I've ever had with them, and really it wasn't a big deal, was that one single pad shrunk once. (I'd say that these are slightly larger than silver dollars and when mine shrunk, it was probably twice the size of a quarter.)  I never had that issue with any others.  I'm not sure why exactly it happened either.  Both pads had been kept the same temperature and washed gently with soap and water daily.  Like I said, it wasn't a big deal, just interesting more than anything.
