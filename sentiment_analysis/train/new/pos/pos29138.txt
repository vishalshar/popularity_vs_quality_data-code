This is a very nice mobile at an affordable price.  My daughter loves it.  The colors match the picture and the music for is clear.  it was easy to put together.  I like that you can wind it up ahead of time, lock it in place, then unlock it when you want it to play.It slides back & forth a bit but I think that is more due to the shape of the crib and not a problem with the mobile itself.I gave it a 4 because it some times gets stuck.  Every once in a while one of the butterflies or flower gets caught on stem and stops it from spinning.  Even though it stops spinning the music continues.Overall I'm happy with this and would recommend it to others.
