I searched for a long time for a lightweight stroller before finally selecting the Jeep Wrangler g-edition.  I cannot tell you how many different reviews I read on countless strollers (UPPA baby, Kolcraft, Britax, Chicco, etc).  After reading hundreds of reviews I came to the decision that there is not one perfect stroller and everybody has their own likes and dislikes.  This stroller would have received 5 stars if not for a couple design flaws.First I will mention the great things about this stoller:**  It is VERY sturdy (can hold up to a 50 lb. child)**  Cupholder stays on pretty secure and can hold bigger cups**  My son is very comfortable in the seat and I like the padded shoulder harness - easy to buckle and unbuckle**  One switch opens and closes the stroller - stiff at first, but then get much easier**  My 4 1/2 yr old daughter is able to fit in this stroller comfortably**  Seat and canopy are made from PET recycled fiber - better for the environment!**  Good ride on either pavement, sidewalks or smooth surfaces**  Will not topple backwards when you put a diaper bag on the handles or shopping bags**  Reclines a good amount - not all the way, but enough for my son to sleep very well**  It has mesh pockets on the inside (where you child sits) to store snacks or a couple toysNow for the flaws:**  The basket underneath is almost worhtless.  You cannot put a diaper bag underneath due to the design of the stroller.  The bars crisscross in the back making the basket not very acessible.  You can fit a couple smaller bags or a small purse, but not much else.**  The handles are pretty high - good for taller people, but I would not recommend for someone under 5'4" (I am 5'5").**  I have kicked the wheels a couple times when I have been out walking.  It seems the back wheels should be set further apart or the handles should come back further so if you have a long stride then you would be less likely to kick the wheels.Overall I am very happy with my purchase (paid $99 with free shipping).  My son likes riding in the stroller and I have a feeling it will last for a long time.
