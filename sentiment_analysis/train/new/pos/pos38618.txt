We love the Nuby sippys, but kept losing them or accidentally intermixing parts from other brands we had tried. This was a great purchase for us. We got enough of the cups at one time that we could remove the others from the mix and stop stressing about whether every cup returned from Grammy's house. The price per cup worked out to be the least expensive I could find, even with shipping.
