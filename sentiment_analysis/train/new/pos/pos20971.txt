I got this as a non-registry gift for my baby shower and didn't think much of it. I attached it to the crib and after two years I'm still amazed at how much my son loves it! He'll pull the crank a few times when he's settling down to sleep. It's a wonderful soother for him when he wakes up in the middle of the night too. I love that he can play the music himself and we don't have to turn it on for him. Sadly, the one we received as a gift has worn out. It'll only play 5 seconds of the song these days and stays stretched out. We loved it so much that we came on to amazon and found a new one. Definitely worth it to replace it and I'm not upset at all that it's worn out - my son is pretty rough on it. Great buy. I highly recommend!
