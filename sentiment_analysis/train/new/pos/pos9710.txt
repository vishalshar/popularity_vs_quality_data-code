I got this snuggle nest just before our son was born thinking it might come in handy.  Well, it is fabulous!  It keeps him "protected" within solid walls while still allowing him to be close enough to sense and smell us. It also keeps life easy for me when he wakes in the middle of the night to nurse or get a diaper change.  I don't have to wait for him to cry loud enough to wake me from another room.  I hear him fuss and 'bam', I'm awake.  Also, the DVD that came with the item is FANTASTIC!  The Happiest Baby on the Block, ROCKS!  Definately a must see for any new parent whether having your first or 10th (alright well maybe not 10th as by then you are some kind of child rearing god & goddess).  It is amazing to see the techniques described actually work when applied to my own baby.I will say if you have a small bed (ie., anything smaller than queen or extended queen) you will probably be cramped pretty bad with the snuggle nest placed in the middle.
