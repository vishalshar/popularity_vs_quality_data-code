4 years ago I purchased this nighlight for my son. I cannot recommend it enough. It's soft and cool to the touch. It usually ends up in the bed with him, holding it as he slept. Even now, at 9 years old, he uses it to read. The colors are great, it can rotate through or you can set it on a specific color that is most soothing to your child. The red, for example, keeps the room darker while the green is brighter.Love, love, love it. It has stayed off the charger for days and still worked perfectly. I haven't had any issues with the charger station being "fragile" as other reviewers have said. 4 years later - still works as perfectly as it did when we first bought it.GREAT nightlight - if I knew anyone having babies I would totally give these as gifts.
