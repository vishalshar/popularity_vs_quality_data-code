I bought this diaper changer because my previous one was lost on a road trip. I wasn't sure what to expect, because I was used to the one I had before, but when I opened this package I was amazed by how much better this one is set up. I like that it has enough room to store wipes and diapers, yet still close with a fair amount of them in there. The diaper bag dispenser is awesome, because I always lost my diaper bag roll before and I hated the keychain type. There is a fair amount of padding in this one, too, so it seems like my son is more comfortable during on-the-road diaper changes.My husband especially likes this diaper changer, because it fits in his messenger bag - no need to carry my "girly" diaper bag for him!
