I have been cloth diapering for about 2 years and have tried many fitteds, pockets, flats, wool, PUL, etc.Absorbancy - These have held both of my babies overnight (1 a toddler and 1 is 10 months old).  The 10 month old still nurses multiple times a night and still wakes up dry when paired with a substantial wool cover (such as knitting addict, disana, etc).Quality - I have 4 of these and use them exclusively overnight.  I have had them for almost a year and have had no quality issues such as fraying fabric, defective snaps, etc.Fabric - I have purchased both the bamboo and hemp pooters.  The bamboo takes 5 forevers to dry.  The hemp takes about 2.  The properties of hemp allow it to absorb more and dry quicker.  The ONLY issue I have with the hemp is the scratchy feeling of the fabric.  It isn't terrible, but it's definitely not soft like fleece.  I use antipill fleece and cut strips to put on the inside of the diaper so my baby doesn't feel the wetness as bad.Sizing - This will NOT fit a 8 lb baby.  These starting fitting my babies around 12 lbs and they are still substantially sized.  I used them and they work, but just be aware of the bulk.  I would say they started being less bulky around 18 lbs.
