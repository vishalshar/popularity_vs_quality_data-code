We use this for my son after every bath on towel dried hair. It is a fantastic product. Leaves his hair soft but never ever greasy- even if we use many sprays. His hair is between straight and curly, and this keeps the curly just right- no frizz. I would give it 6 stars if I could. I should also mention that I have not tried it on dry hair.
