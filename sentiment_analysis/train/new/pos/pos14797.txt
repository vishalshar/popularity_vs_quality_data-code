My son has been playing in this "garden" sense about 3 weeks old. It's been a great purchase! He's now 11 weeks old and enjoys his time in it every day! He's swinging at the toys and loves it. He kicks his feet, I know we haven't grown out of it yet and won't for a while! Out of all the baby stuff you think you need, this is one great item. The little boppy pillow is great as well, he can sit a little elevated to help with not spending so much time on his back. He also uses it for tummy time. He doesn't like being flat on his tummy but with the little pillow (his size) makes it much more tolerable.  I lay him flat on his back and he coos and plays giving me a chance to wash bottles and feel good he's having some alone time that's productive.
