I originally bought this gift set because I really liked the travel bottle brush & drying rack set. Then I saw the travel spoon (my son's favorite - I bought more of these spoons), the stroller hook, and the snack container. All of which I love and use A LOT! My son is a little too small for the sippy cup - I think that he just needs to get better adjusted to the "flow". And we don't use the wipes dispenser, since we have a few dispensers from the wipes sets that we buy. But overall, great value, definitely worth it! And it would make a fantastic gift for new parents out there!
