My husband picked this out because it's cute. I didn't think our baby would like it because it's tough to handle and doesn't make any noises. It's stuffed solid, not squishy to help her hold onto it. She is 3 months old and likes to hug it. She tries to put it on her face and smiles when it won't stay there. She chews on the stem so I'm glad it's organic. I washed it without any problems in cold water. I let it air dry. I live in Colorado where our winters are dry; it dried quickly, but the might not happen somewhere humid. The color is bright, especially for organic dye.
