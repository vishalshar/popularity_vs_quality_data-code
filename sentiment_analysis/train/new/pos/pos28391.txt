This is the perfect item for any parent with an infant.  It folds up to take into the grocery store to use in the carts which are full of germs.  It is also great for any high chair in restaurants, which are not always as clean as you think!!  It is also a great playtime mat to roll out and lay on the floor when you go to friends house for a visit.
