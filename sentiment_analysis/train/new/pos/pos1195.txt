I can't live without this product.  I use it almost daily, and actually have multiple in my rotation.  I use the steamer basket for ALL kinds of things, not just baby food.  When my kiddo was an infant and just starting solids, I used this product to steam the veggies before I puree'd them in the Magic Bullet.  It worked perfectly.  Now that she is older, the chopper makes the perfect size for toddler hands and we use it to chop veggies, apples, pears, etc and serve to her directly.
