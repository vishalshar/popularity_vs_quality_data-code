I know others weren't pleased with this/said it looked cheap/didn't sparkle/wasn't bright enough/was only for kids' rooms. For me, none of this was true. I ordred 2 to hang over our nightstands - they were in perfect condision (no marks on either of them). They came with 25-watt bulbs already installed, and these are BRIGHT. Possibly even too bright, the light is a little harsh. My husband and I can both read with just these lights on in the bedroom. They come with the equipment to either hardwire or plug in. which was nice. We chose to plug them in and I wish they had come with switches, but we installed switches on the chains right next to us cheaply and easily. And, they do sparkle - they look like glass. For the price, you can't beat the look.
