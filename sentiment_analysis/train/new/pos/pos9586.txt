My husband and son love playing with these! We just got them in the mail and already they are the favorite at bath time. My so goes from eating the fish to sticking them in daddy's beard!The net seems to hold up well. My son enjoys the textures and colors at 9 months. I can tell these will be a favorite for a while. My husband seems to think these will help him enjoy fishing, but secretly I think he enjoys playing with them too!Would definitely recommend.
