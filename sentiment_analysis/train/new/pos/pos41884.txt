I'm working on making pur√©es for my second kid, I'm far more confident and adventerous this time. This book has helped with some tips on cooking (i.e. How to peal and pit a peach) but if you're looking for a step by step detailed recipe this may not be the first book to buy. I think it's a great buy, I view it as a reference book not a recipe book and helps a lot. It's not hard to google something if you need extra help on the best way to cook something.
