Very cute pillow.  Couldn't resist it because I absolutely love the rest of the Skip Hop line.  However note it is very small.  I know the measurements appear on the product page, but I still wasn't expecting it to be quite so small & thin.  It is really just good for decoration, or a very modest back support pillow (I use it in our nursing chair).Also for those picky moms out there who prefer natural fibers, not the back of this pillow is a minky material (100% polyester) and the pillow is poly fill.  The polyester content is clearly stated in the product description so I knew this and am not knocking off any stars for it, but just wanted to point it out in case others are concerned about that (not supposed to be as breathable for baby, etc.).  I also didn't realize it was a minky material, which isn't really my favorite material, but it's very soft and cute so I decided to keep it anyway.
