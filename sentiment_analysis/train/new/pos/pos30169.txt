I have tried 3 different universal parent organizers on my Joovy Caboose and have sent them all back.  I finally purchased the Joovy branded organizer for the Caboose and am happy with my purchase.  It hold 2 cups nicely without any complaints.  The other stretchy areas are good to hold a miscellaneous of things - pacifier, small infant toy, fruit snacks, cell phone, etc.  The zipper pocket in the back is where I hold my keys, money, chapstick.  It stays on the stroller when I fold it and store it.  It is really tight on the stroller so no concerns of it falling off or falling down on the handle.  I am happy with my purchase.
