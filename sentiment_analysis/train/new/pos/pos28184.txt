The product was as pictured. Exactly what I needed for my little one. It covers the standard grocery cart seats and restaurant high chairs great. I don't know how you could put it on one handed though with holding and infant. The cover is a stretch to fit large carts as found at Costco and Sam's Club, but it does cover them.
