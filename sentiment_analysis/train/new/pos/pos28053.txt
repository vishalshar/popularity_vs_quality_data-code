These diapers wash well and dry quick.  I really like the gussets as well.  They hold up all day as long as you change the pre fold appropriately and will hold all night without leaking out.  They come in a great variety of colors and are nicely priced here on Amazon.  One other point of interest is the velcro fasteners in place of snaps which makes tightening the diaper cover a little easier.  A great purchase if you doing cloth diapering.
