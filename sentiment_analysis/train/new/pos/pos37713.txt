First camping trip with a 3 year old grandson who wants everything just like adults.  Sleeping bag was a hit, roasting hot dogs, but having his own chair like the grown ups was great.  Plus, the locking mechanism (which I overlooked) was wonderful for the peace of mind that the whole things wouldn't collapse on him.  He put his water bottle in the cup holder, and we all had so much fun.  It is very well made.  There are so many cheaply made ones on the market and you never really know until you try them, but this one is a winner on all fronts!
