Great price and construction for when you need a spare car seat for a child of 7 as the back comes off to be a booster or left on for longer travel and the child is propped up rather than slouching over when he/she falls asleep.  Appears easy to clean and light weight for ease of transfer in or out of any vehicle.  I would say this seat is great for the transition stage from older tot to young child up to 8 years old if the child is not too large.
