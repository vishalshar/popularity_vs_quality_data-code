These fit the bill! Our application is nearly identical to the product photo - top drawers under marble counters in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry/utility/ski rooms.  We have and are very happy (and safe) with the original KidCo Swivel locks <http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ET8F0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15>, but it was disappointing that they were just slightly too short to fit the top drawers where we would prefer to keep items such as vegetable peelers, pizza cutters, knives, scissors, batteries, razors, etc. The Under Counter Swivel Locks solve that, slowing down or preventing entry by the wee ones (of course, proper supervision is always necessary).  My husband installed them with little time/trouble - though he is experienced having installed quite a few of the original swivel locks.  I originally ordered only one package to be sure they would fit, and with such success/safety, I will be ordering more to be sure that each bathroom, kitchen, laundry and utility room has at least one locking top drawer.
