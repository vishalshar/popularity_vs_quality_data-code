Drying racks don't work or they take too long. And with high humidity it's important that the bottles dry quickly to avoid bacteria.  We all know the dishwasher never dries the bottles so I used to take them out and twirl up papertowels and use them to dry the bottles. This drying wand works quickly but I wish there was the option to remove the chamois and turn it over after a few bottles.  The reason being that when you first insert the drying wand, the top half does most of the drying.  So after 4-5 bottles, the top half of the wand is not as effective at drying the bottom of the remaining bottles.  Due to the nature of the material, it still does a good job but requires more time.  Again, this is just a small complaint as this wand has saved me a ton of time and papertowels! =)The wand I received was blue and the chamois material is not a thick looking as in the picture.  Not a big deal but thought I would mention it.  The other thing I noticed is the top tip has a soft red rubber spikey area and I am not sure what it's supposed to do. Maybe prevent scratches to the bottom of the bottle?? I have the Nuk No Scratch Bottle Brush and it has the same thing but that is used for cleaning. Maybe it should have been chamois at the end instead. Anyway, I love the brush but I can't find it anywhere but Amazon and it's not shipping for another month or two!?!?  Hopefully the one I have will last long enough before I need to replace it.As for the Nuk No Scratch Bottle Brush, see my other review.  Not as happy since it didn't fit the bottles well at all but if they make a smaller thinner version, it will be perfect.  BTW, I use the Dr Brown Bottles.
