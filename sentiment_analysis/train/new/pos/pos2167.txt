First off whoever is selling this pacifier holder for $20 is NUTS, you can buy it at target or at some local drugstores for a little over $3!! Now about the holder, it is soo cute, my daughter has no problem holding it, but some babies might.  All in all it was a good buy for me, but like i said look else where, i think the seller should know this price for a pacifier holder is ridiculous.
