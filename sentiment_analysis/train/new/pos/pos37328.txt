Whomever sewed this didn't pay attention to the pattern so the hem on the one I received is crooked.  It's not just a tiny bit crooked, either.  I can't straighten it out without the difference at the bottom being uneven.  It's basically a piece of fabric rub through a sewing machine and stuffed in a piece of plastic for sale.  There's no real craftsmanship at all.
