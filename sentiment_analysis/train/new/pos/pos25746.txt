From the first minute that the kid puts this on and smiles at you, its worth everything!I like buying Jay Franco brand stuff in stores and on Amazon, because it is always cute and well made.I trusted it with my kids and now continue to with  my grandkids as well. We use this for the pool and also the bath, it is soft, fun and really adorable for toddlers. Great gift item!
