Why didn't I order this sooner! This is the best inflatable tub I've come across. The drain in the bottom is a sturdy, soft plastic. No leaks and nothing for baby to hurt themselves on. The bottom of the tub inflates to create a little cushion, and the plastic is slightly textured to prevent baby from slipping all over the place. The little divot at the "head" seemed a little silly to me (what baby lays down during a bath?!) but my little man surprised me and nestled his head into the divot and relaxed.The suction cup on the back is a genius addition. We just stick the tub to the wall under the shower head when it isn't in use and it's out of the way and doesn't bother us at all. MUCH better than the back and forth we had with the hard plastic baby tub we used when he was a newborn.It's a great size too. It takes up about 2/3 of a full sized tub and still fits my 26lb, 31 inch toddler just fine. He'll be able to use it for a while!I get that the inflatable ducky tub is cute (that's what most of our friends have), but this one is just WAY more functional and I personally think the dancing animal design is cute too. Plus, you can't beat the practicality of the suction cup on the back!
