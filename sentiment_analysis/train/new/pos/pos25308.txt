I loved the Chicco Polly High Chair. It was so easy to use, easy to clean and my daughter loved sitting in it. I hated when she grew out of it. It was so easy to feed her. With all of the adjustable pieces I could move them as she grew and not have to worry about her moving around too much and falling out. The straps came out and I could wash them since they get messy with a baby/toddler. The seat covers wiped off easily or came off if I wanted to wash them more thoroughly. Plus it folds up for easy storage. I recommend this high chair for any parent or grandparent that wants an easy to use high chair.
