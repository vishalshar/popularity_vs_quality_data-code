I will have to admit, I was spoiled with my infant seat of a Chicco Keyfit 30.  To me, that was the ultimate seat with practically no issues.  This seat is also very good.  I purchased this as a seat to leave with my babysitters.  I switch between two babysitters each week, so it was a must to find a seat that was both portable and super easy to install correctly.  This fits the bill on both accounts!  It is light, so it is easy to drag back and forth between cars.  Additionally, since the seat belt can be strapped right over the fabric, it is so easy to install it tight using a seat belt.  I recognize this is a much less expensive seat than the Diono Radian RXT (which is the seat I now use in my own vehicle), but I can definitely tell a difference in the overall quality of the seats.  The Diono sits much lower to the seat (lower center of gravity, which I have read is more safe).  Additionally, the Diono is much, much heavier due to the steel frame, which supposedly makes it a safer seat.  Also, the Diono seat has a much higher weight capacity both rear facing and front facing.  Lastly, the Diono has more head protection with the safety wings than this seat does.  All in all, this Britax works perfect as a seat for the babysitters.  It is safe and easy to install.  For the long trips, I feel a little safer with my baby in the Diono Radian RXT.  However, after using both brands, if I could go back I would probably opt for one of the more expensive Britax Convertible seats as my main carseat instead of the Diono Radian RXT because I am much happier with the ease of use and comfort of the Britax seat.
