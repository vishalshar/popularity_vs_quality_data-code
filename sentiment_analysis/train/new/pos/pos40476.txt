These door flip locks are a childproofing must for curious toddlers & children who love going outside, especially tall & thin toddlers like mine.  We have them on two steel doors with wood frames on the front & side doors of our apartment.Easy to install in under 5 minutes each -- correct placement is about 2/3rds up the door -- these flip locks stop it from budging at all, utterly & completely.  When I or any other adults want to deactivate this lock, it is easy to do with one hand even if the other hand is weighed down with bags and said toddler who wants to be carried to the car.The placement of the flip lock is for a height above 5", so it'll be in use for a long time.  I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on its long-term quality, but I'll come back and do so until my family has no young children in it anymore.Also, the brass/gold color coordinates perfectly with our brass/gold chain door locks under which it sits.This child safety door flip lock by PrimeLine is a fabulous item -- I would & probably will buy them again when I live elsewhere with more external doors!
