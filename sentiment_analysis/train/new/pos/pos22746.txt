I saw this on clearance in a store and checked Amazon first before buying it and found it even cheaper here, so I ordered one since we had some hiking vacations coming up.  Overall great pack, my 3 year old is 35 lbs and we went on one hour-long hike and one 2-hour long hike, and I was fine.  My lower back and shoulders were kinda sore, but I had 35 active lbs on my back, so I expected that. I had read some negative reviews about how it doesn't hold your kid right against your back, so it feels like someone is leaning way back as you hike, and I found that to be true.  It didn't kill my back, but when my son would recline back in his seat I could feel it more.  It's because the seat is a hard frame and you can't pull your kid any closer to your back than the frame will allow, so if your kid wants to lean forward or backward they can, to your detriment.  It would be a simple addition for the company to just add a couple straps that let you pull forward the padded backing that your kid's back rests against, which would keep your kid from leaning back too far. But alas... All in all, though, it's an excellent value compared to much more expensive models, especially considering the sunshade and rain cover.
