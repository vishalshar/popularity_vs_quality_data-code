I keep these in each of my cars, in my tackle box, and in my first aid kit. Sometimes all you really want is a way to clean off your hands. Hand sanitizer is OK for disinfecting, but doesn't do anything to actually clean off your hands. And the larger packages of wipes always seem to dry out shortly after you open them. These single wipes are great because you can leave them somewhere for months or even years until called upon to remove a foul substance from your skin. If you have children, then I don't know why you are bothering to read this review- just buy them, you know you'll use them!
