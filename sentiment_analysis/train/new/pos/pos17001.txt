I ordered this since I saw the other review from a ferret owner and they were exactly right - thank you!Most gates have a bit of a gap on either side that's fine for dogs or babies but big enough for a ferret to either sneak through or to get a nose stuck.  My last gate (this one by First Years - [...]) I had to buy wood and glue it to the sides to fill these gaps.  This one sits really close to the wall on both sides so perfect right out of the box.It also doesn't have the wimpy clips that some of the clear plastic gates have.  Mine fell over once when it wasn't in use and one clip broken.  Couple months later one of my cats pulled it over while jumping it (since it was loose with only one clip set) and the other clip broke.  So less than a year later, I threw away a $40 gate!This one is like the old-style wood gates with a notched bar, a metal bracket and a wooden arm that comes down to lock the gate in base.  And once it's locked down it's VERY secure.  Instead of plastic lattice of the old-style gates it's clear plastic - with only one vertical bar.  As long as you put that side towards the ferrets there's no climbing the gate.  At 32" it's also higher than some gates which prevent any vertical jumping over (not that ferrets can jump very well ;))Definitely recommend and very happy I picked this one.  Solid, well made and surprisingly inexpensive, too!  Also would like to add that I ordered this with regular shipping on Dec 8th and it showed that it wouldn't be here till the 15th.  It arrived on the 12th!
