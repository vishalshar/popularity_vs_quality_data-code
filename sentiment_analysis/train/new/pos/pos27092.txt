Our baby has been using this for 3 months now. It is a solid crib and looks beautiful. Our square mattress (the Nook Pebble) doesn't fit it exactly, so  a rounded corner mattress would have a better fit. With our square mattress, the corners seem to get pushed up a little bit, so the mattress doesn't lie exactly flat. I keep pushing them down and the mattress seems to be conforming to the crib better now. The finish on this is very soft: instant teeth marks! But I expected this after reading the other reviews and looking at pictures. Most wood cribs seem to get teeth marks anyway. I should have put on a chew prevention cloth thing, but it's too late now. I will likely have to re-finish this crib or paint it with an opaque solid color if we end up having another baby use it in the future.
