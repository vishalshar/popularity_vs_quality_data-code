I looked high and low for a great corner cushion for our standalone dresser in our closet. Prior to putting these on, we kept swiping the corners and scraping our arms.  After we put them on, we haven't run into them since. They affix very quickly and we've had no issue with the adhesive. They have kind of a purple tinge - so they're not exactly clear, but maybe that's why we haven't hit them - because you can kind of see them.  I would highly recommend these!
