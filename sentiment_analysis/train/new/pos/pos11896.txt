Don't let these little bottles fool you.  Although the markings measure only up to 3oz, they actually can hold up to 4oz if filling close to the rim.  Personally, I prefer this because the smaller bottle with a tight fit naturally takes up less room in the freezer.  Other than that, we've had no problems with freezing and heating these bottles.  So far none have shown signs of stress from the temperature changes.  I highly recommend this if you are going to be freezing milk.  Again it is durable and saves space.
