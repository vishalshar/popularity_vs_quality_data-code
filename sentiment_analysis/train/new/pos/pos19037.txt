We have 4 of these in our house. They are very well made and stylish. Easy to open for an adult, but secure for small children. The installation is more permanent than some of the pressure fit type gates as you do have to screw it into the wall. If you put it into a stud on both sides, the gate easily holds up to toddlers hanging from it and bigger kids climbing over. I would rate the install as moderately difficult and it is helpful to have 2 adults to do it. Tools needed are a drill with small drill bit and Phillips screw driver or bit, pencil and a level. This is a gate for a place that you will need it for a few months to a few years. After it is no longer needed, you can remove the screws, fill the holes and touch up the paint and you won't even know it was there. Good quality product. Highly recommend.
