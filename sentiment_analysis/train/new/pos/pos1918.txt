The thirsties aio are fabulous diapers in my opinion. These diapers work great they are supper soft, after about 5 washes they never leak. I hang them inside out to dry, I never put them in the dryer not even on low heat. I also don't wash my diapers in hot water I use chlorine free bleach with good quality soap, did you know hot water makes bleach inactive? It's true. @ night I add the thirsties brand cotton velour inserts & they keep my boy dry all night, without the insert they don't leak but he doesnt stay as dry. Even with the insert they are not near as bulky as the thirsties brand duo wrap with a pre-fold, that was just a ridiculous amount of material around his little crotch area! I love the fit of the aio my son is 19lb. He is wearing the size 2 snapped all the way down & with two snaps showing in front (there is one snap left to make the waist tighter). The thirsties brand aio are 100% of our diaper stash & I'm very please with them.
