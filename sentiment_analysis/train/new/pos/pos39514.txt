I had one of these with my first child and loved it. I wish I hadn't gotten rid of it. But I bought a new one and it is still a great product.  I use it everyday. It is so easy to use. I even cut a little piece of PVC and attached it where the side would hook up and I hang a camera a from it so I can still see baby even though it slides next to the bed. This really is great. It has underneath storage, and for rooms like mine that do not have a lot of room this is perfect.
