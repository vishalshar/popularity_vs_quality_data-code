Three years after I purchased this Item, it still performs it's functions wonderfully. I have never taken it down and it has endured the worst of the worst winters and bitter cold weather and also taken strong heat from the hottest of all summers!!! I now use it for my second child and it still looks as great as when I first bought it...colors are still vibrant and it still does what it's supposed to do which is to block out as much of the sun's rays from the baby as possible. Fantastic product and I very highly highly recommend it. Five stars from me!!
