Nice, solid, well built gate, we, not too obtrusive looking.  My only complaint is that I found it really challenging to figure out how to operate the gate. After installing it several times without being able to successfully open it, I called the company. The woman I spoke with didn't get my questions (excellent English, stateside rep I believe). I gave up & sent the 1st gate back as defective. However I liked it enough to try a second one. Same problem - install not to hard but could get it to unlatch.  Finally, after many tries & mounting frustration it opened!  I simply did understand how the mechanism works.Just in case anyone else is as dense as I, here is the secret. Pull back the little tag on the top & sharply pull the gate up. It only needs to come a less than an inch, but it does take some effort.  Definitely child proof & pretty near me proof also.  Now that I understand how it works I like it!  Bear in mind that it does take some effort and a person with weak or painful arms or wrists might have some difficulty.  Other than that it is a great gate.6-15-16:  We recently sold our house & the gate stayed. Observations after having lived with this gate for about a year.  Has held up very well. Became pretty easy to open & close with on hand after a few weeks of practice. I never got the hang of using the foot slide so it remained useless to us.  Am now considering a similar gate for our new house - will probably order  this another one from this company but without the foot opening feature.
