We didn't think we would ever find a cloth diapering solution for our heavy wetting tummy sleeping boy. For months, he seriously peed out of every diaper, cloth or disposable, and woke up crying because he hates being wet.Finally, I came across online forums suggesting Kawaii Baby Goodnight HW. How wonderful to find that Amazon had it, and we could get it right away thanks to Prime!He's now 7 months, and along with Baby Kicks Joey Bunz hemp booster and a Sloomb wool cover, this keeps him dry until morning. It adds up to a slightly pricey initial investment, but a 3 pack of the Joey Bunz, 3 Kawaii Baby diapers and two wool covers have kept us going for months, and should keep us until he is potty trained!
