Works just fine, and makes these bottles quite versatile.  When the child is younger, you can use the larger bottles to carry extra water, and when they're older, you can use the smaller bottles to carry food.As for the description -- as of this writing, the description on amazon.com neglects to mention that this is a 6-pack, and the only stock image provided shows 2 discs.  Make sure you're aware of this before you end up with too many discs.  ;)EDIT: A friend just purchased too many, thinking that there were only 2 discs.  I'm going to attach a photo showing 6 discs.
