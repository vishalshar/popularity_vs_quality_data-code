I've been using this pump for about 8 months and I haven't had any issues. I rented the symphony before this and didn't notice a difference in the amount of milk I was able to pump. The pump is small and super portable, no cord needed but you can pump while plugged in, and battery life seems good (pumped twice a day for 5 days a week on highest setting and still has life left). User memory seems cool although I haven't used it. The only things I don't like is if you bend over too far the milk leaks out (so if you drop anything you'll have to do a deep squat and grab or pick it up after you've finished pumping). It's a little loud compared to the symphony. Overall I am very happy with it.
