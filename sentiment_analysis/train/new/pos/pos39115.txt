I have the "old" version (not the famous one that projects, but the rectangular one) for my first baby... she still uses it so I went and bought one for my son, but then I was intrigued by the moving fish, it seems so much more interesting!I went and bought this version despite the bad reviews on here because I have nothing else to do, and because I've noticed my son LOVES to look at stuff like this, he enjoys crib toys nad mobiles more than SHE ever did.There is nothing wrong with this one, either on its own or compared to the older one. The music sounds better, and the songs are different to me. The lights and bubble mode is great! I don't have a loud motor/bubbler, at least not as loud as my daughter's but it might change with age, who knows.It was very easy to set up and I love how it's set up. If you follow the directions you will be fine. First you attach it to the crib with the straps, then tie the little ropey thing to a slat, and then you take the battery pack, open it, push those little black screws "in," plug it in, and then take an eyeglass screwdriver or one with a thin shaft, and you have to screw it to the toy through the slats. If you are complaining that it falls off that means you didn't screw it in.  Then put the batteries in and screw the door closed and you're done. I love this because now I don't have to take the whole thing off just to change the batteries, and god knows those plastic straps are a pain to do!The fish moving in this one are really cute, they go around in a little parade. Visually appealing, not so simple. Sure it's not a soother in that aspect but you can turn it off and use music only.  The "toys" on it do leave much to be desired, but I'm not a baby. I do know my daughter can entertain herself for hours just spinning the little ball on the old one. Think of it as baby tv.
