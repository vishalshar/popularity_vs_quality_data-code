Y'all.This dog.It's everything.My baby adores this thing. It goes with him everywhere and can calm him down with a power I myself do not possess or pretend to understand. It's been lugged across states, banned from daycare ("Please send a different pacifier. He cries when this one comes out of his mouth." I mean, yeah...that's kind of the point of the pacifier...right?), called back into action at daycare ("Please send the dog pacifier back. We need it." Darn right you do. I told you!), washed in the washer, run through the dishwasher, thrown out of the crib in fits of rage, and snuggled constantly for the last six months. We ultimately had to buy another one so we could have a backup just in case this poor Wubby ever actually falls apart...which it is showing no signs of doing so far, mind you.We got the elephant Wubbanub too - BIG. MISTAKE. Something about the weight of the puppy's limbs helps keep it in place and makes it easier for my son to lug around and get into his mouth. It never gets lost, which was a problem with a lot of our other pacifier attempts; the attached stuffed animal makes it handy to find for the baby and for us. Our boy is now completely independent at using this pacifier; I've watched him search for it to soothe himself while I held my breath from this end of the video monitor, hoping he'd pop this guy in his mouth and head back to dreamland. Success.It's now a go-to gift for all my friends when I found out they are expecting. They're all like, "Oh, so cute," as they pile it up with their other gifts. And it is. Cute, I mean. But just you wait, friends - you'll thank me for this guy later.
