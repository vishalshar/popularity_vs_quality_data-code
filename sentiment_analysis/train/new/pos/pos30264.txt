Love this little pillow. My baby is a new born and use the pillow as a safe place to set baby while I bathe. Would even fit in most rectangular laundry baskets for a casual and safe place for baby to sleep while momma gets a much needed bath. I purchased this pillow for me to use during labor. I had planned on using it in my birth centers tub. I ended up not using it but it is great for baby. works well for the first few days when baby can only have sponge baths.
