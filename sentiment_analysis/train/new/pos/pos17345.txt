I got this for my 5 yo, she LOVES it!It's very pretty colors, the clasp stays hooked, but also pops apart easily, no issues there.My 3 yo also is in love with it (so I need to get her one as well) and my nearly 2 yo has been using it because she's teething! This was an all over win, good quality, very cute, easy to clean, will buy more and I highly recommend.
