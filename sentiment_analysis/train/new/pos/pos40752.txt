And THEN cut through the rest of your sandwich, and you will be golden! My (3.5yo)kiddos love their sandwich cutters (we have this one, and the squares). They "don't like sandwiches", but once they are cut in tiny squares or triangles bread/meat/cheese combos must taste very different as they gobbler them right up :). We also use them for quesadillas, works great!
