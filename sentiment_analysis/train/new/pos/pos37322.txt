We bought this in blue about 2 years ago for our now 3 year old and recently purchased this one for our now 18 month old.  We use it as an art smock and it is perfect for that purpose:Things I love about this smock:adjustable sizinglightweight material that is easy to wearelastic on wrists that keep the sleeves closed at the wrist so that any clothing/skin underneath is not exposed (note that the elastic is not so strong that it could hurt little wrists)full coverage (for the younger one--more like a full body smock and for our older one, more like knee length--I note that the description says 8 months-3 years, but I foresee getting more use out of this than that)easy to wash (evidently this is machine washable, but we have never needed to do so--just give it a wipe with a wet paper towel or wipe when still on the child or rinse under the faucet and hang to dry quickly)Things I don't love:nothing really so far.Would highly recommend this to anyone with toddlers who like to paint or make a mess.
