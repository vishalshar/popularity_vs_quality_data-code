I bought this crib liner as an alternative to the thick fabric bumpers. Didn't want the traditional bumper because of smothering concerns (SIDS) but my baby is very active and often her arms and legs would stick out the crib slats. This mesh liner is great. It keeps her limbs in the crib, I can see through the mesh from a distance, and I feel that there is little to none smothering concern. I was able to pull the liner right across the slats so there are no sags and have the bottom edge of the liner at the top of the mattress so if baby rolls over to the mattress edge, her face isn't pressed into a bunch of bumper fabric.
