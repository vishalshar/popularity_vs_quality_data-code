When my baby started eating food it would always drip down his neck and get on the collar of his shirt. Other bibs, even if they fit well at the neck, wouldn't stop the food from staining his collar. I started tucking a paper towel into his shirt underneath his bib, but it didn't always work or stay in place. Then I heard about these bibs and I knew I had to try them. They are a bit loose on his neck (even now at 7 months), but they do protect his shirt. I just make sure to wipe his neck before taking off the bib. I machine wash and dry them and they hold up very well.
