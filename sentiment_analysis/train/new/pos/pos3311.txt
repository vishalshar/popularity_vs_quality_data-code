I liked the Milkmate system, especially since I could pump, store, and feed without ever having to transfer milk. The simplicity was nice. These bottles worked beautifully. They fit my Medela breastpump without any issues, and I never had any problems with them leaking. For feeding, we just bought a bunch of cheapo Evenflo bottles and used those nipples/collars/tops with the Milkmate bottles.Of course, you can pump/store/feed with pretty much any standard size bottle that has a tight-fitting lid. The only advantage these particular bottles offer is that they do fit into a handy-dandy fridge dispenser (also on amazon), and being straight-sided, you can pack more milk into a tight space. The dispenser was the sole reason I went with this system, since it seemed like a painless way to make sure the older milk got used first. I also wasn't SO sure my stay-at-home hubby would read the labels on a bunch of random bottles thrown in the fridge. If the dispenser isn't a huge deal to you, there are other storage bottles out there that I'm sure are equally good.These bottles come with a plastic spacer thing that fits under the cap, and I think they're supposed to help prevent overfilling and leaks. I gave up on those things since I never had a problem with leaks, and it meant one less part to clean.
