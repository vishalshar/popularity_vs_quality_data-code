This cart cover is all that it advertises. It covers all the metal on the cart around the seat and offers just enough cushion without being too cumbersome. It folds of great to store in the car. The colors and prints are fun. The buckle is easy to take on and off the cart. The extra pockets are great for little things such as hand sanitizer and pacifiers. The flats all have velcro to stay in place. There is even a spot right in front to secure a toy. Very Happy with this purchase!!! I actually accidentally ordered 2, but I am glad because now I can give the second one as a gift.
