Our 2 year-old has very sensitive skin that often chaps no matter how rapidly diapers are changed.  We've used the basic Magic Stick (with GroVia diapers) with good, but not great, results.  Over the last few months the chapping got worse to the point where there was itching that led to scratching that sometimes drew blood.  Around this time the Magic Stick Z was released and we immediately decided to try it.  Within 3 days the chapping was healed and the red skin disappeared.  After several months of use, it's the only thing we've found that routinely heals rather than covers up the problem.It is extremely thick as must be applied slowly, but even so, this is much better than where we were without it.  Also, the smaller stick is something a toddler can manage to hold and apply themselves if they are so interested.
