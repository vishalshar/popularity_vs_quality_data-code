I ordered the Yellow Cherry Blossoms with the green (not blue) birds for my daughter's room. They come as pictured--three sheets with dark brown branches, yellow and peach colored blossoms and green birds--nothing detailed or realistic, but pretty. Some of the bigger pieces include branches and flowers, so if you're not careful, they will stick to themselves between the time you've taken them off the paper and go to stick them on the wall. This happened to me a few times, but with care I was able to un-stick them and get them on the wall. I had to reposition a few pieces 3 or 4 times, and they seem to be holding up as well as the ones that were not repositioned. There isn't a picture to give you an idea of how to hang them. I started off with a tree effect coming up from the floor, but soon realized there weren't enough stickers to do it like that (at least not to my liking) because a lot of the branch stickers are clusters of branches, not individual twigs.  So instead we have them coming out of the side of the closet door, near the top, like a branch. It makes more sense to have most of the branches going sideways since the birds need something to stand on. My little girl helped stick on the blossoms and birds.
