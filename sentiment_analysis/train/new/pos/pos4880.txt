These are PERFECT! I was not expecting much at such a low price point, but these are by far the best bottles I have used. My daughter was exclusively breastfed until I had to return to work. I started her out with tommee tippee bottles, which were fine. But soon I started noticing that she wouldn't really suck when I was attempting to nurse her. It got to be a huge issue so I spent a ton of money on several different brands - including ONE (5oz) BOTTLE that cost $20!! - and these bottles blew them all away. she has to work to get the milk out of the bottle so she doesn't end up scarfing it down (as she did with the other bottles) and getting hiccups and spitting up.. It does increase feed time, which I really appreciated. It takes her the same amount of time to eat from this bottle as she would if she was actually nursing.As far as clean up goes, it's really easy. There is one extra piece that is so easy to clean. And this set even includes the bottle/nipple brush.I can't say enough good things about this bottle and this set is a total steal!!
