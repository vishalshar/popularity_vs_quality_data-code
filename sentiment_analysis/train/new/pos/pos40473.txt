Update to review:  I am updating my review due to the fact that Woolino took the initiative to contact me about this product and ended up giving me a partial refund.  I am impressed that there are still companies that care about customer service and stand behind their products.Original review:This blanket is a nice weight for swaddling as it's not too heavy when wrapped a couple of times around baby.  It's also stretchy so you can really get baby nice and snug.  The wool is soft and is easy to care for since it can be machine washed.  I also find that it dried very quickly tumbled dried on low heat.  My only complaint is that mine came with a small stain near one corner.  It is basically a pea sized yellow dot, and I didn't notice it until it was too late to return it.  For the price I paid I was disappointed that it was already stained.
