As a Grandma, there are so many choices out there as to what Lion King baby things there are to buy a New Grand Baby!  Even when it comes to Mobiles!  I chose this one because the mobile is adorable and has more colors and more to look at. Two different baby lions in different colors, and two cute butterflies, that are darling too.  The other available Lion King mobile has 4 of the same colored baby lions, very uninteresting! This mobile is put together well, and plays soothing musical songs.  I've only seen this mobile on Amazon. I did read the other reviewers, and saw the problems they had but this one is Perfect!  Easy to put together.  Enjoy!
