I'm co-sleeping with my 10 month old, and she's been rolling around quite a bit in her sleep.  I have my bed pushed against the wall on one side, and needed something for the other side.  I was initially concerned because I have a 12" memory foam mattress, and this product is for mattresses up to 10" thick.  I'm glad I went ahead and got it, because it fits perfectly!  It clamps down on the mattress, and is nice and secure.  I love that it goes over the top, so there's no possibility of a gap.  The 15" height from mattress to the top of the rail is sort of overkill in my opinion (you'd have to be doing some really crazy gymnastics in your sleep in order to clear that height!!), but better than being too low.
