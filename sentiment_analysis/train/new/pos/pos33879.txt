I love that these are chemical free. they are very sturdy spoons/forks.  I am unsure how much poking the forks will do, they are more "sporks" but still usable.  The spoons aren't deep, but they will do for us! Was looking for an alternative to the cheapo plastic spoons i have, these are good!  UPDATE: These spork/fork thingy's do actually poke! I like this purchase for sure!  The spoons are small enough to use for a baby or big enough for my toddler who is 2 to use!  I plan on using them when my youngest turns 6 months. Made in USA, TOO!
