I bought this so that my baby would have a soft place to practice sitting up and laying on her tummy in her room. I love how cute the lamb is and how soft it is - it provides the perfect cushion for my baby while she learns how to sit up. She sometimes falls backwards or forwards and I feel better knowing that in the few moments I can't catch her, she falls onto this soft mat instead of the hard floor. She has never cried while falling over on this mat, so I know its cushioning her fall.I took off one star because I noticed there are loose fibers in the material, I see it in my baby's fingers after she's been grabbing onto this mat. She's putting her hands in her mouth every few seconds so I don't want her to eat the fibers, so I'm having to wipe and clean her fingers after she lays on this mat.
