I had first overlooked this style and chose a cartoon character style seat for my duaghter.  My duaghter loved the cartoon on it but the seat itself was horrible.  It would slide around a lot and she was scared to use it.  This seat is the real deal.  There are no pretty pictures on it, it just works.  It grips the seat very well and does not slide around.  I would recomend this to anyone looking for a toilet seat trainer.  One thing to keep in mind is that it would probably be a bit long for the "female only" toilets installed in some apartments by contractors.
