My mother kept a satin blanket that both my brother and I had used when we were little.  She gave it to me for my first child.  Now that my second child is here, it's a bit ragged in places so I looked for another satin blanket to replace it.  I ordered the chocolate colored blanket. It's not as big as the old satin blanket I have (it's only 30 x 40 while my old one is double that) but it's quite soft and snuggly.  I think it will be used more as a "lovely" than to keep her warm.  My daughter loves running her fingers through the faux fur.  My husband says it reminds him of the feel of a chinchilla.  The satin part is nice too :)As soon as I got it, I laid my daughter on it and had to take some photos (I like to pretend I'm a professional photographer ;) )So far no shedding issues.
