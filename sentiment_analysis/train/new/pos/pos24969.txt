I love this diaper. It is great quality for the price.  The only problem i found when ordering them was the sizing listed on amazon's site is wrong but the sizing on the product itself is right( I was aware of this before i ordered from reading a previous review). When ordering disregard the weights listed and follow this sizing which is according to the packaging: small(6 to 13 lbs); medium (13-24 lbs); and large (over 24 lbs).This product also received a poor review for leaking but the reviewer did not use any cover over it. As with any cloth diaper, you have to use a waterproof cover if you do not want it to leak through. There are several out there but if you want something inexpensive and effective, i recommend the dappi vinyl pants they are waterproof and a lot more durable then the plastic versions. In the newborn and small sizes you can get 3 pair for under 4 dollars and in the larger sizes it is 2 pair for under 4 dollars. I also ordered these from amazon and the sizing on these is correctHope this helps!
