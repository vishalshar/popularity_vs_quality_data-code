I am so impressed!  I just received this Britax Frontier 90 Harness Booster for my LO.  This has been the quickest and easiest installation to date.  It took me all of 10 minutes (if that) to install and with ClickTight system the seat does not move!  I usually would have to put my weight on it to get it tight enough, but I only had to take the slack out of the belt and that was it!  I like that there is a slight recline feature and the cup holders are a plus. The seat seems very well made and the steel frame is a huge plus.  This is probably the last seat I will have to buy, but if I were to purchase another it would be a Britax for sure.Note:  After reading reviews and doing some research, I initially decided to go with the Recaro Performance Sport, but had trouble installing it in my car.  (I typically do not have any problems properly installing carseats).  I even took it to the local Fire Station and we still could not get a great fit and the seat still moved a little too much from side to side.  However, even if the seat did fit properly, the seat belt was very tight that it pushed against the cushioning and ultimately my LO's back while she was sitting in the seat--this was because the belt path runs right behind the back cushions.  This, for me, was unacceptable.  I decided to return it and try the Britax that I had also considered.  The Britax was $50 more on Amazon, but was more than worth the higher price.  Also, Amazon customer service was great.  They sent out the new carseat overnight and I received it the next day so I would be able to use as soon as possible.
