Our guy (6 mos. old) is a serious spitter, so he has to have a bib on all day or else we end up changing his outfit every hour.  These bibs are the best blend of function and fashion. They are quite absorbant and easy to wash, but small enough that they allow him to move easily.  They don't bunch up and cover half his face like some of the other bandana bibs we have tried.  And they come in lots of colors so we can match them to his cool outfits!  We might need to move to a bigger bib as our son grows, if he continues to spit up a lot.  But for right now, these are just perfect.
