My twins are on formula only.  They are about 4 months old and go through almost two pitchers of formula per day.  This is an absolute must for those with twins - it saves a ton of time.  We put a black line on it with a sharpie marker to show how far to fill it and then use large measuring cups (1/2 cup) to measure formula.  If you add 32 ounces of water and add 1.5 cups of formula, it saves you the time of having to constantly measure the water and the formula.  We then take a dry erase marker and write the day and time that we made the pitcher on it and stick it in the fridge.  Formula is good for 24 hours after you mix it if you keep it in the fridge, so you need to know when you made it (although it rarely lasts that long in our house).  The mixing mechanism mixes the powder in really well and it's so easy to use.  I would recommend getting two of these, so that you can always have one in use and one being washed (after using this, it will seem like a real pain to make formula bottles the old way, one small scoop at a time).  The sharpie marker will stay on for about 15 cycles through the dishwasher and then you have to reapply it.  The dry erase marker will come off each time (and easily wipes off with a finger or a paper towel) so that it's easy to change the day and time.
