went together easy, stores easy as well,have a small kitchen, all we do is push it by the wall when done, of course we fold it , then store it. my daughter uses it every weekend for her son, and loves it, the baby gets a seat belt and shoulder belt and is very secure and a part thats on the seat,is there  so the baby can,t slide out of the seat, also the pad is fairly thick so the baby sits on a padded seat. the wheels lock as well, we feel that its VERY SAFE
