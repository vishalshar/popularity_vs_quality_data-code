I love this snugli, the lumbar support is a nice added feature. I didn't have one of these with my other children so it took some trial and error to get into and out of it. Once I figured out all of the ins and outs I fell in love. I can take our daughter anywhere with ease. She is too big for the car seat carrier and a little too small to sit up in a grocery cart, but I can easily put her it the snugli and we are off. I can't tell you how many things I can get done with me hands free! She loves the ability to look all around insted of sitting in a car seat when we go to the store. Sometimes the stroller is a little cumbersome, so the snugli works best. I read the other reviews and should probably say that I am 5'10" which may account for the difference in the way that the snugli fit me.
