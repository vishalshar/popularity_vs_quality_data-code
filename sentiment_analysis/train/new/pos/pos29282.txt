We bought this for our son to use at his preschool as they're perfect for nap time on daycare/preschool cots.  This is actually the second one of these that we've purchased, the first is about 2 years old and still in great condition despite being used 5 days a week and frequent washing.  The cloth side isn't scratchy, so fine for my son to sleep on it.  The other side is waterproof, which is great for potty training.  I've found that vinyl will often crack with repeated washing, but I haven't found that to be the case with this at all.  I highly recommend!
