My 5 month old son took to this toy immediately.  It has a tree in the center which you can drop the peek-a-rounds into.  The ball can go over a bridge and down another tree to one of the spinning disks, or it can drop onto a waterfall and onto the other disk.  Either path starts the disks spinning to music and the ball will move around on the disks, bouncing from one to the other.  The disks have colorful pictures on them.  They can also be started (and stopped) by a big red button at the base of the toy.  There are two bugs - one on a tree will move up and down, and one on the waterfall spins.  In addition, my son especially likes a door on the center tree that opens to reveal a sticker of some monkeys.The toy comes with four cute peek-a-rounds (monkey, lion, elephant and parrot) and I purchased an additional set of six.  My son likes them as much as he likes the peek-a-blocks and they are easier for him to hold.My only complaint is the same as the other reviewers - when the balls are bouncing around on the spinning disks it is loud and the music can't be heard.  One thing I really like though, is that when my son stops the disks from spinning by putting his hands on them, there is no horrible grinding sound of the motor like I have found with other toys (e.g. the Incrediblock).
