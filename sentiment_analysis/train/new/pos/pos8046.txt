We were looking for a gate that could span the top of our staircase which is about 52 inches long, that is retractable (so we can easily get through without stepping over anything and possibly falling), and that is safe.  This fit our needs exactly!  Plus, instead of drilling the holes into our post, my husband ziptied a 2x4 into the post and drilled into that.  So when we want to remove the gate we just cut the zipties and no one even knows we had a gate installed there!  The other side of our landing had the spindles so we had to buy the extra hardware.  It was perfect!As far as the actual gate goes, it works like the roll down blinds.  It's a heavy vinyl material that rolls out and in.  It is transparent so you can see what is on the other side.  You have to push down on a button, then push that out and back in and it will roll out quietly.  Then you can use that same hand or the other to grab the handle and roll out the gate until you manuever the end of the gate into the locking tabs/hooks.  To unlock, you do the same thing - push the button in, pull it out, and push it back in.  Remove the end of the gate from the locking hooks.  It takes some practice to figure it out but after a day you'll have it covered.  It can be loud closing it, but we like it so we know when the gate has been opened.  BUT, you can push the button in then roll the gate up with it being quiet!Like I said, we are in love with this option.  We had a hard time finding something that would fit our large opening and that could roll up out of the way easily.  This was a bit pricey but well worth it!  Our daughter has stood against the gate and it held her, same with my hubby.  So, it appears to be safe.  Great product!
