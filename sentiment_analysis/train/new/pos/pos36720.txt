Love this item.  Easy to assemble.  We purchased it with the Badger Basket Shelf Storage Cubby with Three Baskets and placed this underneath.  We bought Express Yourself Primary Colors Peel & Stick Wall stickers and put his name on the bottom.  It stores pretty large items including his toy guitar and B. Meowsic Keyboard which is fairly decent in size along with trucks and cars, etc.  It's also easy to wipe  since it's not really wood.  Great purchase!
