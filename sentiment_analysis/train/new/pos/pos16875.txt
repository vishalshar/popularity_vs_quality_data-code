This is one of the slimmer and trimmer iPhone 5s battery cases I've had the opportunity to evaluate.  It adds very little overall bulk.  This was important to me because I didn't want to take too much away from the look of my 5s.  In my video review, I show its features and how it operates.This battery case, unlike many, is actually MFi certified.  This means that it has gained certification by Apple, to work with all future updates to the iOS.  If you have a battery case that is not MFi, you are not guaranteed that it will work with future updates.  I have made that mistake before with other non-MFi products.It also has "Sync-Through Technology".  This means I can leave my phone in the battery case, while plugged into my PC, and it will still sync to my PC/iTunes.  Most battery cases cannot do this, so this was a really big plus.Overall, I really like this black case and I'll get a lot of use from it.  With the 2400mAh battery, I'll get over an extra full charge to my iPhone before needing to recharge the case again.  When I have the case plugged in to charge, my iPhone will be charged first and then the case will be charged 2nd.I received a review sample for test and evaluation.
