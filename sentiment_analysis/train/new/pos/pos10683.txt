WOW, I'm LOVING these little critter-bags! I wanted to try them out for the sole purpose of holding lotions (body lotion, self-tanner, sunblock, etc.,) in a squeezable container when I get to the bottom of the bottle. As we all know, the hand pump in most of these bottles is like TOO SHORT, leaving a good inch of product in the bottom of most lotion containers. I have tried using the GoTubes, but find even that soft silicon container is way too thick to extrude every last drop of lotion! I was tired of balancing lotion bottles on their caps for weeks till I got every last drop out of them, hence my experimentation with these Squooshies. I not only love the adorable creatures featured, but so far, they work like a CHARM! I just empty the last contents into the wide, zip-lock bottom, make sure no lotion is on that ziplock, seal, and use! Voila! No leakage at home. Next test will be to travel with them, cuz often, flying will add a pressure component that causes leaks. Stay tuned!
