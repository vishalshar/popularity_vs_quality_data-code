In looking for a mattress protector that would be comfortable, chemically safe for not only us but our toddler, AND waterproof, I found that it was very slim pickings!  Almost everything waterproof contained some sort of chemical plastic, which will not only off-gas chemicals but are also prone to melting in the dryer, plus who wants that crinkly, plasticky feel and sound?  Other mattress pads that claimed to be both waterproof and organic either had very mixed reviews about being noisy and/or not even truly waterproof, or that they could not withstand washing, or even upon closer label inspection was only organic fabric covering some sort of plastic middle. In fact, AllerEase brand was the only other one I could find that wasn't simply an organic fabric covering a chemical fill----and it also had reviews about melting in the dryer, being noisy, and not even being really waterproof. Even though this Naturepedic Waterproof Organic Mattress Protector was a little( ok, a lot) pricier than we had intended, we are so very, very happy that we decided to go with it.  You don't even notice that it's there, it's so comfortable, it makes zero noise, it's great quality and washes beautifully, and I love that it has straps rather than full-fitted sides--something to be sure you are aware of because they do offer one that is full-fitted if you would prefer that. The straps make changing it for cleaning such a breeze. There's no chemically smell, which is really important to me because it's something I'm very sensitive to and would easily recommend it for this reason alone, and it's made nontoxic by organic & food-grade products.  Most importantly, I poured a small cup of water on it to test it out and it actually IS waterproof!! Yippee!!  This was exactly what we hoped for, more than well worth the money, and I would absolutely recommend it.
