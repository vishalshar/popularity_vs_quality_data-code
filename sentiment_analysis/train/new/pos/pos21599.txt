I tried this product about 2 days ago.  I had been "plugged up" for a few days and finally felt the urge.  I sat on the toilet, put my feet on the stool, and let it drop.  I felt what I thought was a little nugget fall out of my derriere.  "Ah!  Well, it was worth a shot!"  I said to myself.  I was stunned and amazed, however when I stood up and looked in the bowl.  What felt like a nugget turned out to be a real log jammer!  I was so excited I called my wife over to show her my work, but she politely declined.  (She's always been weird about looking at other people's stools.)  The following morning, I woke up, assumed the position, and dropped another doozy, this one bigger than the previous!  I can't speak for anybody else, but it never seemed like I could get it all.  I'd feel a big one coming, but the end would always break off inside my colon and I could just never force it out.  Not an issue with this simple, yet innovative invention.  I pass one "Python" and I'm done.  You might say it's a "Quality over Quantity" thing.BOTTOM LINE:  I can't say you'll be as happy with this as I am, but I can say that I never thought I could ever look forward to pooping any more than I already did, but I sure do now!
