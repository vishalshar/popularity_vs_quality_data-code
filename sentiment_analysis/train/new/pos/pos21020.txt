I started years and years ago giving newborns their first musical teddy bear.  When I attend a shower, this teddy bear is my first purchase if the expected baby's sex is unknown or if the blue or pink is temp sold out. The colors of the bears are soft and true.  With my very first purchase, I was amazed at the quality of the bear.  Having purchased many musicals before, it far exceeded my expectations.  Full, lush fur, with squeezable, soft body, that still feels strong enough to 'stand/sit up' under playful conditions.  Every single parent has remarked of its durability, first, several months to 2 years after the child has received the bear.  Also, the sound of the alphabet song is loud enough to hear and understand but soft enough to encourage hugging while listening.  Parents have also commented about how, long after the bear has become a full-time companion, the musical part still works as clearly and loudly as the first day.  Several parents have commented their child's first words were singing along with the bear!  I will keep buying these bears as long as I have invitations to baby showers!
