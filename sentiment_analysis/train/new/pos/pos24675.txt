We looked at so many highchairs, but I am very pleased that we settled on this one.  The assembly took about 15 minutes (12 pieces plus 3 screws, 2 bolts, and 2 nuts) with just a screwdriver and pliers.  I have assembled plenty of DIY furniture and such (Ikea bookcases and the like) and this was by far simpler.  I assembled it by myself, and did not have to grow extra arms to hold everything together while doing so.I uploaded some pictures, as the only one on the site is the generic pic.  Among the things you can see: how compactly the highchair folds up, how the tray hangs on the back of the highchair when not needed, how it fits underneath the dining room table.I am very pleased with this purchase.  There are no crevices to clean, so the highchair doesn't get all gunky.  The cover removes easily for cleaning, and I really like the pattern.  The chair rolls easily and folding/unfolding is simple.All in all, very pleased.  Especially for the cost, this highchair seems hard to beat.
