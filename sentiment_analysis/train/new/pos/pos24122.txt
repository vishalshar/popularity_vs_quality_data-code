I recently purchased this for my new born niece and she loves it. It's really pretty and the mattress and padding is comfortable.. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big it was..from the pictures of my niece in it. (I have not seen the basket myself, cz my sister is in the US and me in UK)Also, the basket arrived a few days late because there was a snowstorm in NJ, so that's alright.All in all a good buy.. I would definitely recommend it to friends...
