We bought these appliques to go along with the Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Bedding Set we purchased for our son's nursery.  We also bought the Carters Forest Friends appliques because we thought they would go well along with these (they did).  Both sets were a bit rolled up when they came, so we placed them between a few heavy books for a few days just to let them straighten out before applying them.  We made sure we had all our nursery furniture where we wanted it and laid out all the pieces on the floor.Once we knew where we wanted everything (which was the hard part), we started peeling them off and applying them.  They were super easy to apply, and they stuck well to the wall.  We had to move a few of them, and they did not peel any of the paint away during removal and they stuck well the second time we applied them.All in all, I am very pleased with how these look on the wall and how well they match the bedding set.
