Very 'plasticy' and not as attractive as its successor but does the job just as well. I have bought both, and would always buy the newer model if the price is reasonable. If you can't find the new one for a reasonable price the this one is just as sturdy. It has a slightly different folding mechanism and is plastic all around. The frame is metal and sturdy.
