I have bought 8 packs of these and purchased several packs for friends, they are the best.  Our daughter has very sensitive skin so we only use reusable wipes and these are great.  They are super soft even after numerous washings.  Stains wash out great, ours still look new.  No issues with fraying or tearing.  If you're looking for a reusable wipe or even mini burp cloths or face wipes these are the best.
