First, this will handle almost size of sandwich. Before I got this, I was worried that it would only handle a very small, Wonder Bread sandwich, because of it's square shape. But, I was pleasantly surprised when my large Dave's Killer Bread sandwich fit nicely in it, too.It stores grainy, salty stuff like peanuts really well, too. The bag remains smooth on the outside, and keeps all of the graininess on the inside. It's not airtight, so you couldn't store Jell-O in this, but you can store almost everything you need in your lunch sack in this fun bag.It's reusable and washes nicely, also.Pros:+Fun, Dr. Seuss designs+Full sized bag to handle any size sandwich+Works for small, grainy items+Reusable for a healthy environmentCons:-Not air tight, but almost air tight
