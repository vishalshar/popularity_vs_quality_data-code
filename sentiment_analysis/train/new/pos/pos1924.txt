I was worried with how my son was constantly biting the crib rail and had teeth marks all over the crib rail edges. Finally, I found out about crib rail covers. When I searched online, there were all sorts of different types of crib rails with a variety of prices. The Leachco Easy Teether was the less priced one. I purchased it because of the great price despite some reviews about the velcro being easily pulled by the baby. I am glad I purchased it, it has worked for me and my son is entertained with the teether rings that I can secure on the crib rail cover tabs. The only thing I wish for this product to be available in brown.
