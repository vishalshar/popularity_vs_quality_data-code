I use this every time I feed my baby, and its perfect. I love that it has a firmer, flatter side, easier to position the baby on. I have a boppy pillow as well that was handed down to me, and this pillow seems to fit around my waist better and the more round design of the boppy made it difficult to keep the baby in one place, when she wiggled she would start to roll off the boppy and would need repositioning. The vibration unit seemed very sensitive, would turn on with the slightest pressure on the pillow (maybe thats how they intended it), and I didnt want it putting her to sleep when she was supposed to be nursing- but it can easily be removed and replaced as needed. Nice feature to have but still love the pillow without it! Easy to change the cover for washing.
