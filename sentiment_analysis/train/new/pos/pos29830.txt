Reasons these are the perfect toddler pop molds:1.  The handle is the right size and weight for little ones to grasp onto2.  The popsicle stick has holes so that the ice freezes through the handle (preventing the pop from slipping off of the stick)3.  They freeze within about two hours4.  The popsicles are easy to remove from the tray, just run under warm water for 30 seconds5.  Can remove one at a time or all four, the tray separates for your convenience6.  Eye catching colors, fun for kids and easy to distinguish which child has which color7.  Dishwasher safe8.  There is a small reservoir to help hold the drippings9.  The child can rest the unfinished pop on a table, the handle allows the popsicle to be propped up away from the table surface10.  No ten, but the list can't just end at 9- that would  be crazy.
