Perfect way to pack and move the stroller + seat OR bassinet.  We were a little disappointed that the bassinet wouldn't fit without flattening - but we still like the bag.  We were also disappointed that the bag was not completely soft - so you can't just stuff it somewhere.  There is a plastic piece that keeps it somewhat rigid on one side.  But, it does fit in the basket below the stroller.....so it is soft enough.
