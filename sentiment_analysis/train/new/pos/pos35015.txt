This portable potty worked great in helping our daughter to become potty trained.  We would just tell her we had it with us and she could ask to go to the potty any time she wanted.  Great for the park, on car trips, anywhere.  A number of people complained about the difficulty with getting it open.  That's really only the first few days.  For the first week, open it first thing in the morning a couple times before taking it out with you for the day.  After that first week, you'll never have a problem with it. It's the right size.  It never leaks.  It's easy to clean.
