Love this!! We use this everywhere we go to keep the sun off our 4 mo old. There are bees outside my house and I feel so much more comfortable going outside with him now. The only thing I'll mention that is a negative is that it gets very hot in there if you keep the solid flap down (to completely block sun). Just be careful to check in on the baby, as I was surprised by how hot it got in there. Most of the time I just use the mesh part which is fine, and doesn't get too hot.
