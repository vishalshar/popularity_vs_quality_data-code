Just got this for our 22 month old son, to replace an awful First Years' model.  This one is great--the single piece design is easy to clean, the opening is big enough but not too big, it fits quite securely in our (round) toilet, but most importantly, the guard is very effective!  Not uncomfortable but great coverage.At the moment, our little guy needs help getting on and off over the guard, but I suspect as he gets bigger that won't be a problem.  Also, yes, it can be a little tippy if he only grabs one handle, but I think that's the case with all handled potty seats--I don't really know how they'd fix that in something designed to be removed often.  But young toddlers should be supervised and assisted around the toilet anyway, so again, not a problem for us.We love it!
