This is cute and durable. I originally purchased this item in 2011 and in September of 2015, it's still functioning. It sticks best to fiberglass tubs, nothing with tile seems to hold well. It has plenty of room and it's easy to clean. Every few months I spray it down with Clorox clean-up and let it dry for a few days and it's back in action. Awesome value!
