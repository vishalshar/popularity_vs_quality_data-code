As a mother of twins, I considered buying a compact stroller after realizing the difficulty of having a full-sized one. I searched and did a lot of evaluation, reading reviews and product information. I finally decided on purchasing Maclaren. I am glad I made the right choice! It fits narrow spaces and practically all regular doors, yep, surprisingly it does! At times I had to maneuver it correctly,for it to fit the narrowest door, I don't care doing that because it fits after all! My twins sit comfortably in it. It came with built-in mesh underneath, cup holders and rain cover.
