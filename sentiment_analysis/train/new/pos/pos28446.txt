I ordered this bag, because I had outgrown my other one. The package arrived on time, no damage to the box. The bag was not quite as big as the picture made it look, however I am happy with it. There are two outside pockets for sippy cups or bottles, but those are the only two pockets. On the inside there is a zipper pouch in the middle to put stuff in. There is a smaller zip pouch on the right side of the bag, I put chap stick and destin in, but its not really big enough to hold much else. There are also two small pockets and I mean small pockets, I put a few pacifiers in one and some Tylenol in the other, because there was no room for much else. I am not horribly disappointed in the bag, but I do wish that it was more holders for bottles or sippy cups. Also, one of my bottles leaked inside the bag, and since it was only water I threw it in the dryer for a few minutes, had no problems with that, but have no idea how it would wash since I haven't had to yet. Overall I am happy with this bag, but if you are wanting a diaper bag with plenty of pockets, this is not the bag you want!!!!
