This bath towel set isn't just for babies. It's also perfect for toddlers or young children.The towel is nice and sturdy and thick - and large! I'm glad it is so large - will be able to use it for a long time I am sure.The wash cloth is so nice and soft - but it is huge! I'm kind of glad because it won't be one of those "baby" wash clothes that eventually gets thrown away or donated. We'll be able to continue to use it even after baby is grown up. I plan on ordering an extra pack of the plain wash cloths to cycle through. Check Amazon Warehouse prices for these as they show up pretty often! They say used but mine came appearing to be new in box!
