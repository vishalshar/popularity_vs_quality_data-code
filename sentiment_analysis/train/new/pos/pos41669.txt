We bought a full size Naturepedic organic mattress for our toddler's crib when he was born almost 2 years ago, and it's been the best purchase.  So when shopping for a mattress for the mini-crib his sister will be sleeping in, I knew I wanted another Naturepedic.  So many other organic mattresses are more expensive because they are made with wool and latex - 2 things I happen to be allergic to.  I liked that this one is made from something I feel is safe for my baby to sleep on, and I feel the price is fair after actually seeing how well it works in our crib.This portacrib pad/mattress fits the DaVinci/Baby Mod mini cribs perfectly.  Our  mini crib came with a mattress that was horrible (although the cribs are great), it had gaps between the side and the mattress, and the mattress itself was flimsy and covered in vinyl.  This Naturepedic mattress fits great, with a nice tight fit, and it's firm enough for a newborn.  It's much sturdier and even half an inch thicker than the mattress provided by our crib manufacturer.  I know some reviewers were worried that it's only 2 inches thick, and it's labeled as a "pad", but it is a mattress, and very high quality.I highly recommend this mattress, and in case you're wondering, we've found that the Carter's Portacrib Sheets fit it perfectly.
