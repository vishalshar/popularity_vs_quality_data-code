This is a fantastic lunchbox for a young toddler. The Skip Hop Lunch Kit fits perfectly inside and leaves extra room for a juice box and ice pack also. Something I also like about this lunch box is that it's easily washed in the washing machine and dryer. The inside is easy to wash out with a wet rag and the entire lunchbox is durable. Plus, it's adorable. Great price for high quality and cute product!
