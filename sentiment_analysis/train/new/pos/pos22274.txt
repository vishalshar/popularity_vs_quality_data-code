My daughter was exclusively breastfed (EBF) since she was born. We purchased these at Babies R'Us because I disapprove using plastic bottles for a baby. We also had the Medela bottles and some Avent bottles as well (from the breast pumps).We tried giving her a bottle about a month  before I returned to work so she starts being use to being bottle fed. Surprisingly she would ONLY take these. She refused the Medela & Avent ones even though they were made for breastfed babies.These were cheaper in store actually ($13.99). But they had a sale buy one get one half off on top of their sale price $8.79. Sadly they didn't have them available at my Babies R'Us store so I had to order online here to avoid paying shipping fees. (It was $11.99 when I ordered now I noticed the price has increased!)Love these bottles and would highly recommend them. They were also pretty sturdy. They have fallen a couple times and still didn't break! Nipples are also real cheap to replace.
