I was reluctant to buy this stroller organizer with so few reviews.  I am glad I took the chance!  I have a Maclaren Techno Classic stroller.  The storage bag fits well. I love how it folds up with my stroller so I don't have to bother with taking it on and off to store the stroller in the trunk!  Its so nice to have a drink holder now!  The top row has two evenly sized pockets.  The bottom row has a larger pocket and a smaller one.If the canopy on my stroller is not being used and is folded back, it does limit the access to the bottom two pockets.  You can still use the pockets, but the canopy is in the way a bit.  If the canopy is open to protect baby from the sun, then it is out of the way and I have full access to the bottom two pockets.  I pulled back the canopy and put a drink in the large bottom pocket and walked around Costco. The canopy was a little in the way, but still usable.I also have a Maclaren Volo stroller.  I haven't tried the organizer on it but I can not see any reason it wouldn't work on that stroller as well.I am happy.  Just what I needed.  I would buy again. :)
