I purchased these dryer balls because you can't use dryer sheets or fabric softeners on cloths diapers and I wanted to reduce the amount of chemicals in my house.  They do just what they're supposed do-- cut drying time and eliminate the need for chemical softeners.  However, you definitely need more than the three that come in the set.  These ones are smallish, I suggest using at least six (two sets) to make the most out of them.  They tend to hide in sleeves, pant legs, the folds in fitted sheets, etc., so you often have to do some searching.  I plan on purchasing a kit to make more balls (since it is cheaper) so I can have a basket full on hand to save the search time in the laundry room.
