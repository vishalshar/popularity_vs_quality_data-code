The pops and drops are very effective, but I much prefer the drops.  The lollies are poorly made: often the "pop" material extends all the way down the stick, making for a very messy handhold, and the lollies tend to dissolve in such a way that they create sharp bits.  The drops are much more convenient and discrete since I don't have a stick hanging out of my mouth, and they dissolve the way you would expect them too with rounded edges the whole time.  If ordering again, I would only order the drops.
