So in love with this changing pad cover. It is so soft. The owls are adorable. I couldn't find a changing pad cover that even remotely matched the theme of my crib set, so I just decided to choose a changing pad cover that I thought was cute, regardless of whether or not it matched her bedding. So glad I chose this one, all the bright colors have actually allowed me to incorperate other bright items in the nursery, such as recieving blankets and burp clothes that also have owls on them and all the bright colors you see in the changing pad cover, without it looking like a complete mess. The holes in the changing pad cover were perfectly aligned for the safety staps, I was worried about that. I was also a little worried about it fitting the changing pad but it fit like a glove. Very very pleased with this purchase. Wish I would've bought 2!
