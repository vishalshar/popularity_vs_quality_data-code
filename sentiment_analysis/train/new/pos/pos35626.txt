I usually don't write reviews, but I just had to on this one because I am so happy with it!  I have never purchased pacifiers from amazon before because I couldn't find a prime eligible seller who offered both color selection and size options. Usually you can find size options easily but it will say "colors may vary" so you don't know if you'll be getting boy or girl colors. This one you can choose both, so happy, will definitely buy from again!
