What a godsend. For my baby shower all I received was Johnson & Johnson bath products. I should have listened to others when they told me that I should not use those products on my baby. Considering that I had a lifetime supply I figured, hey it's baby products! What harm can they really do I mean they are designed for babies right?Well it wasn't until my daughter broke out in a rash all over her body that I decided okay I need to be a little bit more selective with what I put on my baby's skin. So I remember that in the hospital I received tiny samples of the playful wash and how much I liked it when I used it in the hospital so I decided to order the full-size bottles and I'm so glad I did. I've only been using the line again for a few days but I can already see some small improvements in my daughter's skin. Her cradle cap is lessening and her rash is diminishing little by little. Overall the line is very moisturizing and I love the lack of chemicals in comparison to the Johnson & Johnson products.
