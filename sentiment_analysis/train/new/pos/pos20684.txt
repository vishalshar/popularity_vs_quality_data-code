I love this little high chair! You can easily strap it onto a regualr chair or use it on the floor when needed. I bought it to put in our living room, so my youngest could have snacks while still hanging out with me and the other kids during playtime. It was nice not having to move everyone around the house a lot (I have 3 boys, ages 4, 3, and 1...things get crazy. ha) We've had it for about 5 or 6 months now and it's still in great shape. The padding on the back was a struggle to put on, but I didn't mind because it stays in place and is really easy to clean. It definitely makes my little man more comfy than having an all plastic seat. You can recline this seat as well, which is very convenient. The tray goes on and off easily, you can do it one handed. Also, you can adjust the height. Over all, I would totally recommend this to my friends and family.
