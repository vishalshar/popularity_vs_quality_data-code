I have a 10 month old son and he likes to squirm around a lot when he sleeps.  Having a blanket attached is great (so it does not fall on the ground.  Also, this was a life saver on our trip across the country!  On the plane we normally don't have a good solution for his sleeping but when my husband and myself travel together we just put the Baby Boom Nap Mat across our laps and bingo, he has a sleeping spot:)  The pillow is not a thick one but it's good for him because he can't have a thick pillow anyway (SIDS risk).  You could easily replace the pillow with a different one (like a camping pillow) if you really wanted to.  We have washed this and it keeps its softness to the blanket part....and BOY is it nice and soft!  Just because its soft does not mean that it piles, either!  Maybe it would be too short for some kids but I can see that mine has plenty to grow into.  It's light and bundles up nicely.  It even has a window where you can put your child's name.."This belongs to...." so that they don't get confused at daycare.  I bought this with the Regalo My Cot Portable Bed and LOVE it!  For the price, there is no better (I'm picky and I READ lots of reviews).
