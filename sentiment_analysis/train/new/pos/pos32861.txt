I RESEARCHED WALKERS AND ACTIVITY CENTERS FOR MONTHS BEFORE I FINALLY DECIDED ON THIS ONE!! IT IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE, QUALITY AND AMAZING FEATURES!! THE PIANO PLAYS 3 DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF SONGS AND TUNES AND ALL THE BUTTONS ARE EASY TO PRESS AND KEEP OUR SON INTERESTED FOR QUITE A WHILE. WE PUT OUR SON IN IT AT 4 MONTHS AND HE LOVES IT!! YOU CAN RAISE AND LOWER IT DEPENDING ON HOW YOUNG YOUR BABY IS. WE HAVE IT AT THE LOWEST POINT NOW SO OUR SON BARELY TOUCHES THE FLOOR AND HE REALLY ENJOYS IT! WE EVEN PUT A SMALL PILLOW UNDER HIS FEET SO HE CAN TOUCH THE FLOOR AND ITS ALMOST LIKE A JUMPER FOR HIM. THIS 3-IN-1 CENTER IS PRICED VERY REASONABLE AND SAVES A LOT OF SPACE FROM HAVING TO PURCHASE 3 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS! YOUR BABY WILL GET GREAT USE OUT OF THIS AND KEEP THEM OCCUPIED LONG ENOUGH TO GET STUFF DONE AROUND THE HOUSE!!
