Very easy to assemble. All you have to do is just twist the legs on. The color is a really soft light pink. The image shown is way darker well at least on my monitor it is. This chair is great for a two or three year old. If your child is the destructive jumping/climbing type or is in that stage I recommend not leaving them alone with the chair. My daughter can easily flip the chair over and likes to bounce on it. But when shes in the mood for tv she sits very well. Overall a very cute chair seems pretty sturdy.
