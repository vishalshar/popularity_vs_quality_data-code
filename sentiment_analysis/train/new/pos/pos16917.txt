Bought this pillow because starting around month 5 of my pregnancy I would wake up in the middle of the night just so uncomfortable.  This pillow is fantastic and the first night I had it I was finally able to sleep through the night again.Two cons:-I like my beds pretty firm and this pillow makes my sleep area really soft, sometimes too soft.- The biggest issue is only if you have dogs. I'm in week 3 of having this pillow and and my boxer mix has figured out just how great this pillow is. I now wake up in the middle of the night again. Not so much because I'm uncomfortable from my pregnancy but because my dog completely takes over and pushes me out.
