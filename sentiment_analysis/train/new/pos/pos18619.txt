This product was a lifesaver for me!  I couldn't quite make it work with my first child, but I knew I would have to when I had my second.  I started putting her in it immediately--at first she would cry and scream in it unless she was very tired, but then I figured out a way to wear it that she liked.  I would put her in the "snuggle hold" and then fold the lip of the sling back so that her head and outside arm were not constricted but her body was still safely in the sling.  She LOVES this!  I can now tend to my son and get other things done, while she rides along looking out at the world.  I put her in it whenever I am out at the store, mall, taking a walk, etc.  I feel better knowing that she is being held rather than just stuck in a stroller all the time, and I can still attend to my older child and get things done.  People always stop me and say that they tried the sling but couldn't make it work.  My advice is to fiddle with different positions until you find one that your baby likes.  I am now so dependent on this sling that it is difficult to find time to wash it!
