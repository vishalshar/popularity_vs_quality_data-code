I'm reading everyone review and I see that they all hate this bed rail. but I have no problem with this bed rail. I actually read the review about the other safey 1 bed rail (sure position-n-lock bedrail)and I told myself I wouldn't get it cause the review was bad. but when I when to the store yesterday to buy a bed rail, they just had two kinds this one (which I taught was the sure position-n-lock. now I see its not)and another which I didn't like. so I pick this one with the intention that I might have to return it. I put it together, the two screw were a little hard to screw in. but after that everything was fine. its very easy to put on the (full size) bed and to pull up and put back down, and it has a VERY STRONG GRIP on the bed. which I think is the best because that means it won't move and it didn't. I play around with it some to see if it would fall apart and it hasn't. so for me I think this is the perfect and the best kind of bed rail you would want to keep your child safe because it grips onto the bed.
