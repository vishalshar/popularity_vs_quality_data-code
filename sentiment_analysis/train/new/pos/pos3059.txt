My 5 month son was having trouble sleeping in his crib and the very first night that he slept with this he slept great.I was worried about it being breathable because babies aren't supposed to sleep with anything. It is. You can hold it up to your mouth and breath through it with no problem.Having three of these has been handy, he slobbers all over them and we can just rotate them out.
