I just love these more and more. We were having an issue with a lot of brands of crib sheets shrinking up and becoming a hassle to get on, or my son being able to pull the corners up when he got bored. We have also been slowly switching my 2 year olds room from giraffe-themed stuff to a mix of giraffes and dinosaurs, same colors as this sheet set too. : ] Bought these, tried them on before washing them and they were actually a little big. They have now been washed and dried several times exactly as the directions on the tag say, and they fit perfect now. Another awesome tidbit is that the first night I put these on my son's bed, I took him over to the crib before our usual bedtime story, and pointed out his new colorful bed sheets. He smiled, giggled, and reached for the bed. Storytime was skipped that night. I could hear him on the baby monitor cooing and laughing for about 30 minutes before silence commenced. I'm pretty sure from his initial reaction he was having a ball studying his new and interesting bed sheets! : ] A great buy, great quality, thick and soft sheets that are well worth the slightly higher price.
