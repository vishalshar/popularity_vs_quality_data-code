My exclusively breastfed son tolerates this bottle he best out of the Momma, Bornfree, and Calma; however, he's never latched on. He just plays with the nipple, chewing on it and letting most of the milk fall out the corners of his mouth. My husband insists that this one works the best because he drinks some of it. It did leak once. I'm not sure why but it didn't happen again. For me I can't give it five stars because he hasn't latched onto it which is kind of the point. Note: My son bottle fed with no difficulty at about 1 month with bornfree bottles and started rejecting the bottle at about two months. Since then he's only latched onto the Momma bottle once but never again. We're still trying with the adiri bottle next.
