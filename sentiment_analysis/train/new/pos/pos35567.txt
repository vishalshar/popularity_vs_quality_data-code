I purchased 4 of these diapers thinking they were a one size( which was my own fault for not reading), but they aren't.  I was still able to fit them on my newborn due to the hip snaps.  Any leakage we had was definitely due to the fact that I bought the wrong size.  I like the unique "pocket" that catches everything and also prevents leakage.  This also allows you room to add an extra soaker or whatnot if you wanted to.  I did it just to see if it would work, which it did, but it wasn't really needed for my baby.  I love the removable velcro tabs.  The velcro is very good, and still hasn't needed replacing after countless washes and 8 months of continuous use. The prints I got are adorable! If I could get these with snaps instead of velcro, I would probably get some more (in the right size this time).
