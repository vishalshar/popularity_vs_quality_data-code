Cloud B outdid themselves with this car. it is great because its wheels roll, and the headlights + tail lights work independently of each other while the main light glows and projects stars. It has tons of play options but it remains a trusty night light that the kids can take to bed with them. It is tough too just like twilight turtle, each of our 3 kids has one and they've been jumping on them without a scratch, this car is the same.The projection is actually stars and lightning bolts, perfect for little boys.I bought this as a present for 5 my year old nephew and he loves it.Important, you need to know:- The left tail light is the main on/off switch- The right tail light is the projection color switcher- The left side of number plate switches the head lights on or off- The right side of the number plate switches the tail lights on/off
