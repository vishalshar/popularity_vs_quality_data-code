We wanted this for our 'jungle themed' nursery but were looking for something not too bright, loud or tacky looking to go with a bedding set we purchased from pottery barn kids (which did not come with a matching mobile) and the colors in this mobile were just the right complement. The hanging toys are cute & soft and the whole mobile was easy to put together. The lullaby melody wasn't the best or sweetest but it's not a deal-breaker either. It has an on-off switch but no volume control - wish it did (but is not excessively loud either). The mobile also rotates gently. Overall a good purchase and not expensive compared to some other (very horrible) crib mobiles we have seen.  Would recommend.
