We like the overall design of this can because it doesn't involve the tiny bag refills and it's quick for getting in and out of a room at night. The design is fairly simple, larger lid for changing the underlying standard 13 gallon kitchen bags which are anything but proprietary, and then a smaller lid that’s there for dropping in diapers.We're on our third pail after three kids, but the fundamental design flaw is that over time (maybe a little over a year), the springs for the small lid break and fall into the abyss of human waste. Rather than searching for the spring to see if it's salvageable, we've opted to just replace the pails entirely since they’re cheap enough. The others I end up using in the garage as just regular waste baskets.Also, I've found with two of them that the small lid opening when new, requires a bit of manipulation (pushing the plastic tab a little) so that the release lever works smoothly. Again, don’t push the point that it cracks, just to the point that the spring loaded release pops up the smaller door lid more easily when you’re breaking in the product.I wasn’t paid or asked to endorse this product. My words are my own and I enjoy providing feedback to the Amazon community since reading reviews is imperative for me whenever I research a product, so I believe in giving back and providing my own feedback as well.
