These are really good in freezing baby food. The food does pop out for me after I twist the tray and then push the food up from the bottom. When first taking it out of the freezer they will be frozen solid. I made a habit of taking the trays out maybe going to do something else (and the something else does not have to be a 5-10 minute chore, only maybe a couple of minutes) come back to the trays and they twist and loosen up the baby food in order for me to pop them out.ALSO DO NOT PUT THESE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WHEN FREEZING. The food will not freeze overnight. They have to have nothing on top of them in the freezer.
