This fit just fine and was easy to put on the stroller.  It DOES work in the newborn/toddler configuration prvided the stroller's sun shade fits over your toddler in the upper seat. If your toddler is so tall that you have to keep the shade back in the newborn/toddler configuration, then this is useless until your infant can ride in the infant/toddler configuration. As others have stated, the cover does fog up fairly quickly but not so much that the kids can't see out.The major design flaw is the toggle at the bottom of the cover.  It's a PITA to undo quickly to let the kids out.  Why P&T didn't use a velcro strap there, I'll never know.
