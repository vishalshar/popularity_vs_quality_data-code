When I first opened the package, I was skeptical.  How could such a tiny bag cost so much?  Once I opened the net bag and pulled out the blankets and sheets I was very, very happy with the bright colors and the reversible comforter.  My son loves it!  It was worth the price just to get him to sleep in his own bed at night!
