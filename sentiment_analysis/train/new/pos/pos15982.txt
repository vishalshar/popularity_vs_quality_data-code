When I was reading most of the negative reviews for this toy organizer, almost everyone mentioned that it was because it doesn't stay on.Here is what I did (very simple) and it does NOT come off and stays put!Scrub clean your tiles with comet and then wash off.  Let dry and then I wiped the wall again with windex and also cleaned off the round suction part of the toy organizer. After it dries off, stick the organizer and press hard a couple times and thats it. It stays on really well.  I have no problems with it, my 2 year old son would try to yank the mesh bag off sometimes and it still stays on strong.This toy organizer looks great on our bathroom wall :)
