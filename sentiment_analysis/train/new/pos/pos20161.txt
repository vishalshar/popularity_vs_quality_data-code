This is our fourth "flato" cozy and we love them. Yes, they are small, but that's the idea. It's perfect for even the littlest hands and both my 6 month old and two year old them them. The pup has plenty of places for the baby to chew on, which is the main purpose of these in the beginning. The face is very cute and the baby loves getting kisses from his pup. My favorite part, besides the extreme softness and cute factor, is the ease of it being machine washable. They come through the wash beautifully. Overall, i definitely recommend this for any child!
