Great for the few months you can use it. It was awesome to take my babies out of the car and put them on the stroller and go without ever having to take them out of the seat. However, be aware that once the baby outgrows this and you want to continue to use this system you will have to buy a separate car seat and stroller seat. For us (as we do like the product) we purchased standard car seats from a different company and the stroller seats from Orbit Baby as the Orbit Baby car seat is too cumbersome to take in and out of a vehicle. If we would have been a little more thorough with our homework we likely would have bypassed this product.
