Lets just call this product a life saver.  After my second baby was born, I noticed that I was in ALOT more pain after breast feeding then with my first child.  I was recommended this product and found that it was such a relief after feeding my baby.  It has a cooling effect and I believe it really helped heal my nipples during the first few weeks of breast feeing.
