I really like the softness of the deluxe cover compared to some of the other covers available and it I s adjustable on the side. When I originally purchased this nursing pillow it came with the limegreen deluxe cover.  I purchased an extra cover that was not the deluxe; a black-and-white pattern that functioned the same, but preferred the softness of the deluxe cover. Which is why I purchased the navy cover. They are durable too; toss it in the wash and hang dry. I rotate the navy and limegreen deluxe covers and have never had an issue with seams unraveling or fading.
