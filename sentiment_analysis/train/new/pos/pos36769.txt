I finally found the answer to my prayers. After wasting money with the sub standard mats sold everywhere , from Ace Hardware to Wal-Mart's, I have found the most stupendous solution to slipping in the tub, untangling hair from webbed rubber mats, and cleaning moldy slimy surfaces. Buy with confidence! Be careful when preparing the tub for adhesion. Use a small amount of comet, enough to clean out your soap scum, rinse extremely well, and make sure the tub is 100% dry. You can put very heavy books on top to make sure the mat adheres properly. I used my flat  free weights all around and about six heavy gardening books. Mat was ready to use  in 12 hours. I am a very very happy customer!
