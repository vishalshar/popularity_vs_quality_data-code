I bought this from Target instead of Amazon.  Target was way cheaper.I have always loved the ocean and the creatures that are in it.  So naturally I wanted to do my girl's room in an under the sea theme. I thought this bedding would be great because I love dolphins and crabs.  When I saw the picture online it looked like the color behind the dolphin was yellow, but it's actually green.  It still is way cute but imo.Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of the set.  The colors are very pretty and the creatures on it are adorable.
