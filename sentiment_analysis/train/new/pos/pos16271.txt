This came really fast and is just the most adorable little thing. One of my favorite pockets. It's just like most other pockets, soft inside, elastic around the legs. Loads of buttons. We leaked out of it one time, but that was probably due to my own error. Definitely loving it! For what it is, it gets a five star, though all in one's are still easier if you're going to be stuffing.
