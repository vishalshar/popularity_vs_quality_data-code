I use this for my granddaughter when we go out.  It has an elongated bag about 11 inches in length.  It comes with 6 containers about 3x2 inches.  The containers can interlock which isn't easy to attach or take apart at times but it does the job.  You can only put 3 in the bag.  The bag has some insulation component to keep the food cool or hot depending on how it's used.  It's small enough to put in my granddaughters small backpack.  The top of the bag has a strap which you can attach utensils or juice box.
