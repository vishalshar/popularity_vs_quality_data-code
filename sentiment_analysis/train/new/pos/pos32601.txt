I have purchased this stainless steel sippy cup and the Pura Kiki 11 oz natural stainless steel sippy cup and both products are good, but I recommend the Thermos for younger kids that like to throw their sippy cups on the floor from the high chair.  The Pura Kiki cannot tolerate hitting tile floor and the bottom has warped, but is still totally functional and is not my on-the-go cup. I have a one year old son that bites everything he puts in his mouth and the sippy portion of both of these can tolerate him very well.  Unlike the Nuk sippy cups that he completely bit through in five minutes.  I highly recommend this product to someone who is looking for a smaller starter stainless steel sippy cup. My one year old can hold this sippy cup much easier with the handles compared to the Pura Kiki and it tolerates hitting tile very well. Word of caution for people who want a product with absolutely no hard plastic. The handles, blue screw on top, and the part that holds the silicon sippy part into the blue screw on top is hard plastic. This was not a problem for me. The Pura Kiki has no plastic and is simply a stainless steel container with a stainless steel screw on top and the silicon sippy mouth piece.
