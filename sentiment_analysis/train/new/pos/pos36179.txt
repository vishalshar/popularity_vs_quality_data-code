I shopped for several months before chosing this travel system. We have had it for a year now and we are passing it along to a family member so they too can enjoy the benefits of this travel system. I love the fact that it has been so sturdy. It has been great for a day at the mall, amusement park, & even on the beach. It was a little harder to travel through security at the airport with the stroller because of it's size. Here are some of the things I love and then some things I didn't like.Pros:Car seat has removable supports for the newborn babies.Can remove everything both on carseat & stroller except the sun shades for washing.Comfortable carrying handle of the carseat.Stroller makes a bassinet for those times you want to take the baby out of the carseat but they are to young for a regular stroller.Small compartment at the top of the stroller to put wipes and underneath there is a small hidden storage compartment.Stroller has a large underneath storage.2 cup holders for parents and 2 cupholders & tray for the baby on the stroller.Easy to close & open the stroller.Even after a year of use (every day for seat & 2-3 times a week for stroller) it looks almost brand new so it is made of high quality material.Front wheels of the stroller go in every direction for easy navigation.Cons:Have had some problems navigating the stroller in some stores and sometimes in & out of doors because of the size.Stroller takes up a large amount of my trunk and sometimes it was hard to get in & out of the trunk.I have had to oil the wheels of the stroller.I would have loved to have had 2 bases for the car seat for easy between both of our family vehicles.All and all I have loved this travel system.
