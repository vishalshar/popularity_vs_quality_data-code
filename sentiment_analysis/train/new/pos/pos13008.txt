We used this stroller/car seat carrier with our Maxi Cosi Mico and it worked out great!  To note, it does not 'click' in like the other systems out there. You pull the red straps under the side bars and snap it on top.  Some reviewers felt this was not secure enough. We've used this system for 4+ months and had no safety issues. (If you don't like the way this looks, we simply wrapped a blanket around it. Kept baby warm too!).The carrier is smooth and pushes like a dream!  The basket is HUGE and can hold a large baby bag, a winter coat, and 2+ shopping bags.  Compared to other carriers out there, the basket is much bigger. The drink tray at the top is nice and convenient. It folds, and unfolds, very easily. We pushed this carrier on grass, bumpy sidewalks and random surfaces- the Jeep tires handled great!  I will be sad when my baby grows out of his car seat and we will have to move him to a bigger stroller. In all my research of strollers (Baby Jogger City series, Uppababy, etc.), they do not have the convenient drink holder and large basket like this one. We will miss this!
