I've had just about every double stroller and was sick of the oversized bulky frames. I have a big two year old and a big 9 month old so I wanted the strollers seats to be tall enough but also fold small and be easy to get in and out of the car on a daily basis. I love this stroller because I get that and more. I love that the handles are taller and angled so your not kicking the wheels and  that the seats recline so my kids can nap. I would have to say the only things I don't like about this stroller is the sun shade, while better than most, I hate that I have to take it off before folding the stroller and that the sun shade is not big enough. I use this stroller for most of my errands which usually are indoors so the sun shade isn't really needed.
