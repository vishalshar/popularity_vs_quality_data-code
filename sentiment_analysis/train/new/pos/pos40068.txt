I have used Baltic amber on my baby since she was about 3 months old.  I lost her necklace, so I bought this one to replace it and it's far superior to my first and I'm very happy with it!1. The amber is a beautiful light color. (The light colors are better for teething.)2. There is a knot between each bead, so if this breaks, your baby isn't going to have 50 beads bouncing everywhere, trying to shove them all in her mouth.3. The clasp is genius!  It's a tension release clasp.  It holds firmly, but not so firmly as to make it a choking hazard if it were to catch on anything.  (Think of those collars they make for cats, tug on it and it comes off.)4. Not only is it practical, the design is thoughtful and beautiful.  The bigger beads are in the front, gradually becoming smaller and smaller toward the back.5. Most importantly, this is not a hoaky thing!  It really works.  We've never had to give Tylenol or anything for teething pain.  As a matter of fact, I didn't even notice her teeth were coming until I saw the skin broken one day.  She never complained!
