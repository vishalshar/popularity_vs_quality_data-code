I was skeptical of these and new to cloth diapering so I ordered this trial to test. Love them! No leaks even at night! They wash well but prefolds take a long time to dry. Anyway, I ordered the kit that costs about $50. It comes with 3 covers and 12 prefolds. It also includes a wet bag. The bag is not even worth having. Four of these trials gives 4 covers instead of 3 and 12 prefolds for less money than the kit. I wish I would have taken that into consideration but at least I can share my advice with you.
