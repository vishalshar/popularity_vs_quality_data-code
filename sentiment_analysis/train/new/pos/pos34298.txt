I go back to work in 5 days and my 2.5 month old would take no bottle. At all. I was in a panic, ready to beg my office to extend leave or arrange to have my little miss brought to me every 2-3 hours.I bought this bottle during one of my I should be sleeping but I'm too tired to sleep shopping searches. It was pricey, but I figured worth a try.Well, low and behold, she latched almost instantly to this bottle. The crying stopped and she downed 3 ounces.The panic is gone! I'm no longer terrified my babe will starve and I won't have to quit my job and go live in a cardboard box to keep exclusively breastfeeding. Hurrah!
