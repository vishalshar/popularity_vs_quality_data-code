Speaking as someone who works in the electronics industry, most baby monitors are simply junk.  I've owned several of them.  The Philips model is the one we kept and the one we used.  It has a crystal-clear signal and zero annoying interference.That said, I have read the reviews of people who have had trouble with this unit, and I think I understand what's happening in those cases.  The monitor has a sensitivity adjustment.  This is a useful feature: if you don't want to hear every little sound coming from your baby's room, you can set the sensitivity accordingly.  When the adjustment is done correctly, you won't hear every yawn and stretch, but you will hear your child crying or calling for you.But, here's the problem:  the same buttons that adjust the volume on the parent unit also adjust the sensitivity.  To adjust the volume, you press the +/- buttons.  To adjust the sensitivity, you press the "sensitivity button" (which is sort of hidden on the side), and then press the +/- buttons.  Hence, it is really easy to adjust the sensitivity by accident, when you think you're adjusting the volume.  Poor user interface design, to be sure.  But when this monitor is adjusted correctly, we've found it to work much better than any other we've tried.
