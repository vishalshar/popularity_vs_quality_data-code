Love these swaddles. We covered swaddling in our baby 101 class but after our daughter was born realized swaddling a wiggly new born is a lot different to swaddling a doll... These were a great solution and a real sleep saver. We tried a number of different brands but likes the quality of these swaddles best. They was really well. We have noticed some discrepancy in sizing, our daughter was on the larger size at 8lbs 2oz and 22 inches long we had to sew additional poppers to one of our small-medium swaddles as it was too small but she easily fitted in another.
