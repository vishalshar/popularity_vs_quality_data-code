My daughter just turned 3 months old and usually screams within 1 min of being put on her tummy. When I have put her on the tummy time mats with the pillow she usually finds a way to push herself off of it and screams with her face in the pillow. This is a neat idea. She fits perfect on the seat that spins. She is 23 inches long. That mat though is very small, much smaller than I thought it would be. The toys are fun. My daughter really has no interest in the toys yet, but does love the mirror. When I put her on it for the first time she smiled and laughed and watched herself in the mirror for about 5 minutes before she started to cry. I figure that is pretty good for a first try. She has only had it for a few days and still only stays on for about 5 minutes. She has not learned to spin yet. She enjoys me laying her on her back to the spinner and spinning her around the room though. Overall this is a fun toy for her to play on with or w/o the spinner. I think she will enjoy this toy when she is able to sit on her own. I don't think though that this will help her learn to crawl like good old fashion tummy time.
