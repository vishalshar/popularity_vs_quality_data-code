I bought the Baby Jogger City Micro in slate to use as my car/travel stroller for my 20 month old 29# 36" tall toddler. I used it at the airport last week twice & it was wonderful! Easy to fold & pop the wheels off for going through the x-ray machine @ security checkpoint & folded quickly when we go to the end of the jetway for gate checking. Steers great one handed and isn't tippy. I was able to hang my diaper bag off the handle using Mommy hooks (look @ Lowe's for unbranded carbiners that are several dollars cheaper). The harness is not the most structured but my toddler doesn't seem to mind. This is definitely a toddler & up stroller with minimal recline. It has a higher seatback than most strollers out there and my little guy seems to love it. The day I got it, I set it up in a separate room & when I brought him downstairs after his nap, he wandered into that room & I found him sitting in the stroller with the cutest look on his face like he was really getting away with something. The handle bar is high & has a steep curve to it - I am 5'8" and think it is great - a shorter person may not agree. I took it to Butterfly World in Coconut Creek, FL & to Fashion Square in Pompano Beach, FL & loved the way it handled. I even took it over some grass & it glided. I have a Valco trimode AT stroller for walks around home & park and think the City Micro is a nice complement to this larger stroller for keeping in the car and for traveling.Edited to add:I have now had this stroller for 9 months - still love it! I found out that the 8" front wheel from the City Mini fits this stroller & I ordered it from Baby Jogger for $15 - it makes this stroller AWESOME! I will never load my AT stroller in my car again!
