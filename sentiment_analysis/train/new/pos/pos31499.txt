I have twin 9 month old identical sons. They love these blankets and I am just so happy they do! We have 2 blues, and two sages and they are both adorable. My sons have sensitive skin and these blankets are great for them. They cover them in the crib sometimes, in the car, in the stroller, in the morning, on the floor EVERYWHERE. These blankets have held up to so many washings and abuse and they dont show any of it! These are just so durable that you would think they were made of metal or something! But there isnt any blanket in the world softer than these and my sons are big fans of the pacifire, and just love to suck on the satin edges! I just cant believe how great these blankets are, and they arent fleece which isnt comfortable for a baby at all! They arent too big nor to small and my sons love them. I would never dream of giving up my blankets, and I really would recomend them to anyone (they come in sage, blue, white, yellow and pink)
