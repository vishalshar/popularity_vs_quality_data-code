My 10 month old son was drawn to the cow and the dvd instantly. He actually dances to the music. He really pays attention to the tv while the dvd is playing in a way he never has before. The first cow would not interact with the dvd or cd but Tiny Love was great in exchanging the cow for another one. They even tested it before sending the new one out to make sure it would work. Expensive toy but worth it.
