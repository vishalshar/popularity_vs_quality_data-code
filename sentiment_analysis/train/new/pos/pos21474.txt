There is a reason that Boppys have covers in the first place, which means you have to have at least two.  We were excited to find this organic cover to complement our other organic one but were a little disappointed that it's not as soft or comfortable as the first.  But it's definitely cuter and goes nicely with our baby's decor, which makes up for the lacking softness.  And it's way better than the old synthetic-fiber Boppy cover we've had for several years.  The only real downside is that the brown dye that was used for the piping bleeds a bit, which means there is a bit of a brown "shadow" on the main part of the cover wherever there is piping.  I'm assuming it's because the dye that was used was not as harsh and therefore didn't have the staying power as some other dyes, which means it's definitely not a deal-breaker for me, and it's not really very noticeable, but it's definitely something to consider.
