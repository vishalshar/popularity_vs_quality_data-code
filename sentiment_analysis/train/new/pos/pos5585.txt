I researched strollers for a long time and decided on the Keekaroo because it met my specifications.  We travel across the county three times a year and I wanted a stroller that could stand up to being used and abused.  This stroller is FANTASTIC.  I am 5'7" and I have to say that although my toes don't ever hit the back of it when using it for regular use, when I have tried to use it for exercise purposes they do hit at times.  However, I am not exaggerating when I say that I have hauled this stroller around the airport with probably 30 lbs of bags hanging off the handles and my daughter in the seat and it works fantastic.  It has been thrown on and off airplane wing checks more times than I can count and nothing on it is ripped or worn.  My daughter now weighs 37 lbs and it still fits her great.  It is safe and really easy to maneuver.  The basket on the bottom is not huge, but I have been able to put my purse or another small bag in it.  If your child is upright, no problem, if they are sleeping it is a tighter squeeze. I have been so happy to have the shade on top and it is plenty big.  The ONLY thing is it doesn't have a cup holder, but.... I would gladly give that up for everything else it has.  It breaks down easily and when my daughter was a year, NOT WALKING and I traveled alone across the country with her.  I held her, took all my bags off the handles, broke it down (and set it up) all with one hand.  I am IN LOVE with this stroller - it is worth the money!
