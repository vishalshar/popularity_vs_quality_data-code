I actually got my first Similac SimplySmart bottle as a sample before I had my daughter.  We exclusively breastfed for 3 weeks and then I decided to introduce the bottle so that she would take one when I went back to work.  I pumped some breast milk and she took to the bottle right away.  The nipple on this bottle is a bit more firm than some others on the market that I've tried.  The shape and how it is made reminds me of the Avent bottles which I used with one of my other kids.I like the smart close on the bottle.  If you can see the blue portion after you screw the top on, you know it's sealed.  We haven't had any leaks which is really nice.  We never use the easy mix and take them out of the bottle.  I'd rather shake the bottle so I don't understand having something mixed.My daughter is 4 months old now and I'm back to work part time.  She still has only every had breast milk, but I feel like this bottle has been so great.  She takes it while I'm away and then does great at the breast when I come home.  I would recommend it.
