I knocked off a star only because I feel $48 is a lot to pay for a single stretch of fabric, which is pretty much all this is. Yes, it's beautiful fabric, lightweight but strong, and it's nicely hemmed with the "Happy" logo right in the center. It's also long enough to wrap around myself twice (I'm average-sized), and there's enough stretch to be comfortable, but it still holds its shape. It's definitely great fabric. But it's just fabric. There are no bells and whistles. I imagine you could make the exact same wrap with material you buy yourself from the fabric store, for a fraction of the price.That being said, it's truly a great wrap. Learning to tie it takes no time at all (seriously, it's easier than tying a man's tie) and my baby, who doesn't like being in a Bjorn, falls asleep instantly when I wear him in this. The key is to tie it tighter, then put the baby in. Once he's in, you can loosen it a bit if you need to, and make the shoulders wider or narrower, etc. It'll take a couple of wraps to figure out how exactly you and the baby like it, but if you feel like your baby is sagging, then you just need to tie it tighter. My favorite thing about the wrap is that the material is thin and soft, but really strong (which I guess is what you're really paying for). He and I both get really hot when we're close to each other, and neither of us sweats in this.Totally recommend it. If it was a bit cheaper (say, $35 - which is more what I think this is worth), I'd have bought it in two different colors.
