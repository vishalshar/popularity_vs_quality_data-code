My husband and I felt rather overwhelmed when looking for a crib for our first child. I really stumbled onto this particular crib, but I'm so glad I did! The price was the first thing that caught my eye - it's hard to beat the numbers when compared to all of the ridiculously expensive cribs on the market. We knew we wanted a convertible crib too, so check there.The crib was in perfect condition, no funny smells. The color is true to picture and description. It was incredibly easy to assemble. It's very sturdy too - that's what I was most worried about buying this online with no reviews to read through. But it's solid as a rock.Now we're just a few weeks away from meeting our little man, and we look forward to the many good years ahead with this crib/toddler bed.
