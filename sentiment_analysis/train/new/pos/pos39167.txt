Mommy and daddy approved!  I needed a double stroller to go jogging and hiking. I also wanted a stroller to do my everyday routines which you cannot do with a locked front wheel (a stroller that has swivel and locked front wheel). I narrowed it down to two double strollers. The BOB Revolution Pro Dualie  and the Baby Jogger Summit X3.  Knowing I was going to spend $600 plus I wanted to make sure I wouldn't have any regrets.  All the sites I went to are biased.  I'm a mommy and I choose what was best for us.  I do own a BOB single stroller but the Jogging Summit X3 is so much better. I bought the Baby Jogger Summit X3 double stroller and this is why:-There is a center bar between the seats. (the BOB double stroller sags in the middle because it doesn't have the center bar).- All-wheel independent suspension (the BOB only has suspension on the back wheels).-Ergonomic handlebar which you can wipe to clean it (the BOB has a padded handlebar so its hard to clean).-The canopy has peek-a-boo windows & ventilation panels. Even if the canopy is down the kids can look out through the ventilation panels and will have a nice breeze coming in on the hot days(the BOB doesn't have ventilation panels).-The front wheel locks and unlocks at arms length (with the BOB you have to stop to  lock and unlock).-One step quick fold (the BOB is 2 steps to fold).I love it! I have a new favorite!
