I bought this for my sixteen month old for Christmas.  I wasn't shopping for it, just wanted to up my purchase to the level where I would get free shipping!  However, it ends up my little man loves these things!  He likes nesting them and playing with them individually.  He takes them apart and tries to carry them all around in his arms.  They are bright and colorful, but also sturdy.  They have been dropped/thrown down on our hardwood floors many times in the last few weeks and are still like new.  Another plus is that no batteries are required!
