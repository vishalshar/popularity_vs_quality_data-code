I use this pad as a place to change my infant's diaper -- either as a cover for his changing table cushion, or as a stand alone on the bed/sofa/floor. I have several other changing pad covers and this one is by far my favorite because it is soft (not vinyl or plastic coated like others, which does not seem nice against my baby's skin), and waterproof enough that we have not experienced any leaks through to the other side when my baby pees during a diaper change. Furthermore, because it is somewhat heavyweight, it stays flat and is hard for my baby's roving hands to grip and pull on during a diaper change, which he does with some other lighter weight changing pad covers. Further, it has a smoother texture, unlike some more fuzzy ones that I got from a different company, and as a result seems to stay cleaner looking. Although not recommended in the washing instructions, I put it in the washing machine (hot water) and dryer, and it's holding up great (5 months of heavy use). It did shrink a bit in the dryer, though I didn't mind since it is still big enough for diaper changes. I am buying another one.
