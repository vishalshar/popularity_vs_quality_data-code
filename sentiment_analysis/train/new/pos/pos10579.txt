I purchased this swing for a new daycare baby. Love the bright colors and the fact that it plugs in. Other features that I like are the side-to-side or front-to-back swinging option, the wonderful mobile which features up-and-down movement, and the music/rainfall noises. All of these options work independently of one another, which makes this product even more appealing. The padded insert is quite useful for younger infants who lack control over their heads and bodies. It provides additional stability for wobbly heads and less controlled bodies. Further, a five-point harness makes this swing much safer than past swing I have owned and provides peace-of-mind for parents who may have to leave the room briefly.There are no rough edges on the plastic pieces. Assembly, for mechanically inclined individuals, is easy and quick.
