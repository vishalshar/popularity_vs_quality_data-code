These are great, multi sized, containers. The set includes 6 of the 2oz jars and 4 of the 4oz jars as well as holding trays for both sizes. We use them regularly and store food in the freezer then carry a few to daycare. Lids for both snap on tightly and keep everything from getting freezer burn or from leaking in a bag or freezer (which is great). They are also durable enough to be tossed about, knocked off a high chair, dropped out of a refrigerator etc. without breaking or cracking.Smaller containers (2oz) are not quite enough for a full meal but work perfectly as a snack or pair nicely together to make a 2 item meal for our little one. They are also just big enough to hold other various items, like a small homemade muffin, crackers, scoops of peas, etc.The holding tray are a little cumbersome and take up room but keep the containers from falling through cracks or grates in our freezer. It would be nice if the containers nested a little better when full so you could stack one on top of the other. When not full the containers nest nicely for more compact storage, but the lids to not so you need to find a handy cubby or risk losing them.
