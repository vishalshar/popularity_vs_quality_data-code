Perfect for my six-month-old just starting solids. They're durable, flexible (a MUST for packing in a diaper bag), and don't have sharp edges to cut her neck. They wipe clean with ease. The only thing I wish was different was that it would cover her shoulders better. Some food does get on her shoulders sometimes (partly depending on how puffed her sleeves are), and as she gets older it will probably be easier for her to yank the bib off, but otherwise I'm completely happy with them. I wouldn't trade these for any cloth-plastic hybrid with impossible-to-clean-out pocket corners.Oh, and they double as a fun teething toy when feed time is over. Nice for those little gums.
