I love quality dolls, but could not afford the cost or space to collect them. This little doll is stunning in its simplicity. The paint is rich and shiny, and the detail is better than pictured.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that her head is posable.  A demure tilt, and voila! A new expression.  Will look for more of these darlings.
