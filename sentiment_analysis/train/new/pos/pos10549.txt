These are THE BEST!  Had my first set for almost 5 years before they broke because I somehow got them stuck the wrong way while folding my stroller.  FYI, Maximum weight per hook is 6lbs, since it doesn't say in the product description.  But I'm positive it holds a lot more.  I've put everything on these hooks, including heavy bags of groceries on the hooks and they held out like champs!  Not sure what people are putting on the hooks to complain about them breaking...Just as a side note, if you purchase from BIGFLYSPORTS beware that you may not get the colors that are shown on the product page.  I got some heinous purple/green combo which I immediately returned and bought the red/yellow ones from Babies R Us.
