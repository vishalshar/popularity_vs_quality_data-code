This was recommended by a friend and has been my go to cover..positives:-It doesn't scream nursing cover, which was a priority for me-large enough to hide from the top and sides-was able to use it as a shawl at a wedding when my little one was only a month old. if you put it on so the hole is at the top on your back, you don't even see the opening and it just looks like a shawlnegatives:-can get warm under the cover, especially in warmer weather-I would prefer if it didn't have fringes as I feel they can just get in the way and are more likely to get stuck in zippers in my diaper bag when stored there-because it doesn't have a stiff edge like other nursing covers, it can be difficult to see in the top while both of your hands are tied up help with latching/positioning.
