They work great. I bought one from walmart not his model but close. The one from walmart streches to fit the window and has 4 suction cups on it but it doesnt block the sun. These however do a great job or at least my 10 1/2 month old loves em. He doesnt get fussy n e more when i pick him up cause the sun come through the back glass and these block a majority off the sun
