I put this on my registery before I read all the reviews. When I got it, I was a little nervous, but thought I would keep it and see if I encountered any problems with it....and I did not.I've used it a bunch of times now and it works perfectly. More importantly, my son loves it!I found the spray to be just the right amount. I can't imagine why anyone would want it stronger because it comes out well enough to rinse off the baby and can easily be controlled to avoid getting water in baby's eyes.I would recommend this product, but I will admit that it isn't a necessity. It's definitely one of those silly items new parents want to get.
