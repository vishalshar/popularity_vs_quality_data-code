My Daughter wasn't really a fan of this device but when I was able to coax her into using it, she would use it until everything was either melted or no longer frozen/cold. If you decide to use anything other than ice, such as: frozen berries, bananas, or vegetables, I would suggest the use of a bib and having your child situated in a place that can be cleaned up easily. I learned that one the hard way, lol!
