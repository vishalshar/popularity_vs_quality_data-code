I bought these along with several other sizes of this type of butterfly for my baby girl's bedroom.  They come with a string attached so you can hang them but I ended up cutting off all of the strings and just mounting them on the wall using a tiny piece of mounting tape (like the stuff those 3M wall hooks come with) and created a 3-D collage. With the different sizes and various colors of brown and pink that I purchased, they look adorable. So glad  I got them!
