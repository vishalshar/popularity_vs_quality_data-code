I'm finishing up a kitchen update, and a big part of that update was adding Trend Lab Versailles products to it!  My cabinets, countertops, and backsplashes are white and black, and I had the walls in the kitchen/breakfast area painted a deep warm red.  I bought these valances for the bay window in the breakfast area and for the window over the kitchen sink.  They are exactly the right accent against the deep red walls!As far as the weight of the fabric goes, the top section of white with black gridwork is a lighter weight percale fabric.  The black strip underneath is satin, and the damask section at the bottom is a lightweight twill.  I did find some loose threads that needed trimming, but no biggie.  The low price more than makes up for me spending 10 minutes cleaning up thread ends...I collect medieval/renaissance prints/tchotchkies, and the damask quatrefoil pattern ties in nicely.  I added a wide black satin ribbon to the bottom of each valance panel, to lengthen them and to tie in to the black satin insert under the rod pocket.  I bought the clock and a few of the matching fabric bins too :)My only wish is that Trend Labs would expand the Versailles product line to take it outside the nursery offically.  Table linens, for example, would be AWESOME.
