I love that the compartments are separate and don't leak when closed properly. These make packing lunches so much easier! I use them for mine and my child's lunches.The only downside is that the container is odd-shaped and large, making it hard to find a lunchbox to carry it in. That's a fairly minor complaint, given that the container is good enough to function as the lunchbox on its own.Note that if you have a child who doesn't always finish their lunch and is younger/less careful, you probably want to pack them lunches that have no liquid components--it will leak if not closed tightly.
