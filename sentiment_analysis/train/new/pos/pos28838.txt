I have been a happy owner of a 1-oz boogie bulb (green) and I wrote a separate review about it. Since my baby is growing I now purchased a 2-oz bulb (blue). It works exactly the same only it now fits the little nostrils better. The tip needs to cover the nostril in order to get snot out in one suction.I take it apart after each use, rinse, use a pipe cleaner to clean inside the tip, air dry.Important: you have to hold it correctly (see pics) - then it works like a charm.
