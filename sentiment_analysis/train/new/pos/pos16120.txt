Just had a big car accident yesterday, front impact with car traveling in opposite direction. my car was totaled. I had some bruises and my wife too. The baby did not receive a single scratch. Definitively would recommend this car seat. After the accident the plastic parts show the stress they were exposed to, the seat did a great job.
