When my daughter started refusing to put the toddler seat on, this was a good solution to the problem.  It seems more "grown up" so she doesn't mind using it, however it only fit one of our two toilet seat covers.  I would've bought two otherwise.  The only other problem is that my daughter takes a long time on the potty sometimes and can be a wiggle worm.  It is a thinner plastic that works great until she begins wiggling too much.  It can pop off if she's not careful.  Most times, it works perfectly though.  Great solution to the "too big" for a potty seat problem.  And much more affordable!
