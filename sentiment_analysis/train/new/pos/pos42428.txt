Fit well on my Nissan Altima with the thicker rear view mirror (due to buttons for the garage door opener). It is a little small (but aren't they all?) and the reflective plastic that acts as the mirror could be improved but I prefer this type over the other kind that is supposed to clip to a visor. Ended up ordering two more (one for car #2 + grandma's car).  It does take a little getting used to since it blocks some of your normal line of sight out of the front windshield.
