Amber necklaces are great for teething babies.  After numerous recommendations from friends, my wife finally ordered this for our daughter who has suffered a great deal from teething pain. The necklace fits our daughter well but the necklace seems to be strung together by very thin string. I am worried that she will pull the necklace and break it.  However it is better than the alternative - which is her choking herself on it.  If the necklace gets caught on something then it could cause your child to choke.  Also if the necklace breaks and your child decides to eat the beads then that is another choking risk.  I would recommend this to parents but would advise them to only let their child wear it under close supervision due to the hazards involved.
