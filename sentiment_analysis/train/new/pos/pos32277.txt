I received some of these bibs as a baby gift and fell in love.  They are perfect for on the go bc you can just wipe them with a baby wipe and reuse them.  I bought several of them bc I love them that much.  My regular bibs were getting stains from the food, not convenient for taking to park, restaurants, etc...and required so much laundry.  Plus I love how cute these are : )
