I needed a pencil pouch for school that wasn't too bulky, but had enough space for me to put things like highlighters, pens, pencils, etc. I looked at a bunch of different ones but what I didn't like about most of them is that they were so large and couldn't fit nicely into a small bag, while still fitting stuff into it. I was kind of skeptical about this pouch for its size. I like the look of it and everything but wasn't sure if it could fit a lot. I got mine in the mail today! First off, the order was suppose to come in tomorrow so I like how fast it got here! It looks just as the picture shows it, and it's the perfect size! I fit 5 highlighters, 3 pens, 2 pencils, and a regular sized Sharpie into it and it wasn't bulgy at all :) Even when I opened it, the items I put in it didn't come falling out. The bag still stayed in a nice small shape, but expanding (not stretching) a little to fit everything just right. I would DEFINITELY recommend this for any school items like pens and stuff that you need to carry, but don't want some huge or kiddish pencil pouch.
