Loved the tots bots v3s, but they are on to V4s now.  Absorbency on the V3s could be improved, they are best for daytime diapers.  Easy to wash and dry, very resistant to stains and stink.  Was a synthetic polar fleece inner on the v3s, but it was nice on the skin and never had rash issues.  Run a bit bigger than bum genius, fit much longer. Aplix is great and held up well! Of note, tots bots held resale value the best out of any of the cloth I tried.  Daddy friendly!
