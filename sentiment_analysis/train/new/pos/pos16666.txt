Three kids in, and NUK orthodontic silicone pacifiers are still my favorites. These sports designs are very cute. Go ahead and buy pacifiers in bulk; get a couple dozen. It will save you from tossing sofa pillows and crawling under dining tables looking for a pacifier while baby screams. If you're a little nutty like me, you can keep different designs in different places (e.g., I keep yellow ones in the crib, alphabet ones in the stroller, animal ones in my diaper bag...). That way when you randomly find a pacifier in the refrigerator (???!), you'll know where to put it so that it'll be on hand when you need it.
