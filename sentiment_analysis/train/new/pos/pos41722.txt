I have had this stroller on my wish list for 2 years while we waited to adopt.  Once our baby arrived, it was the first thing I purchased! Easy to put together, use and navigate!  It handles so seamlessly and turns 360 in very tight spaces!  I love that you can face the seat towards or away from you and doing so is so easy!
