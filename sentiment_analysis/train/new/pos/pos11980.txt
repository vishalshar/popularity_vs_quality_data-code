They work fine but my son hated them and felt like he was being punished.  So... he only wore them maybe a handful of times.We compromised, I explained that if he had an accident then he'd have to wear them for the rest of the day.Well, he must have hated them so much that it convinced him to not have an accident and his accidents dramatically were reduced. I may have started using the waterproof pants a little late because it really only took a couple of tough months of potty training and we were done.
