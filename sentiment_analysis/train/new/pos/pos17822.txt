We bought this seat (two actually, one for each bathroom) shortly before my son started potty training.  It really helped him make the jump from potty to toilet.  Most training seats are just gross.  Clipping them on and off is a real pain and if you leave them on you can't use the toilet for adults or close the lid before flushing.  With this model you can close the lid before flushing.  When you don't need the small seat (having adults over for the evening, after the child starts using the big seat) it clips up securely.  I also love that it looks just like the regular big seat which can help kids make the leap, much better than using a cushy seat covered with cartoons in my opinion.A lot of reviews say that the seat doesn't stay up for the menfolk but we didn't have that problem.  You need to jiggle it a little when installing; there's a little give and if you attach it at the very back the seat will fall but if you do it towards the front it won't.  If I had to complain I'd say that the lid is a bit heavy to lift when the small seat is latched up but it's not a big deal really, even my two year old (who now uses the big seat) can lift and lower it without trouble.
