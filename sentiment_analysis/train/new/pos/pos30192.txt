These letters are adorable.  They are perfect for helping little kids learn their ABC's.  We especially like how detailed the animal drawings are...my only complaint is the letter I...why an Ibex?  It looks like a goat and I think that is confusing to kids...in fact, my daughter said, I is for Ibex, his name is Goat.  We didn't put the little letters with the big letters, rather we spelled some words separately with them and I spelled my kid's names too.  Definite hit in our family.Update:  So we've had these for almost 6 months now and we've had absolutely no problems with them not sticking.  They are on a wall in our kitchen that is painted with semi-gloss paint and the kids touch them all the time because they are at their level.  I'm wondering if maybe they had a bad batch and they don't stick like ours do.  If so, it's a total bummer because these are really cute.Update:  After a year and a half these are still sticking strong.  In fact, my kids can't even peel them from the wall, I've watched them try, so maybe it has to do with the finish on your wall?Update:  After 4 years these look just like they did when we first put them on.  My kids touch them all of the time, they don't move them around, but they still look great.  I will be sad when we ultimately take them down because the graphics are just that cute.
