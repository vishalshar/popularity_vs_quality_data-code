We are very happy with these necklaces for both our girls (3.5/1). Although it's difficult to say whether or not they are providing health benefits, we've heard from more and more friends and family members about their own awareness of amber as a soothing agent. The necklaces are very kid friendly: they are short to prevent choking, smooth and soft to the touch/skin. My girls wear them to bath and to sleep and hardly notice them. My one year old would generally tug on hair clips and accessories but leaves this piece alone. Only thing worth noting - the beads are not nearly as shiny as they are in the photo. The amber is smooth yet quite dull.
