This toy has gotten so much use in our house!  My son loved laying under it and watching the lights even before he was old enough to bat at the toys.  Unlike some other play gyms, this one is very sturdy, and not easily knocked over.  We used this a lot to keep him busy in his bouncer.  It is wide enough to slide right over the bouncer, so he could easily reach the keys and could kick the toys with his feet.  It was his favorite toy when he was first learning to sit.  We would surround him with pillows and set the piano up on the second level.  He would sit there and play his music for 10 minutes at a time (a very long time for a 4 month old).  He is now a walking toddler and still likes this toy in the standing position.The only con is that the orange piece across the top pops off all the time.  The hanging stars also pop off fairly easily, but my son likes pulling them off and playing with them, so I can't really say that's a con...just a pain when I find them all over the house.
