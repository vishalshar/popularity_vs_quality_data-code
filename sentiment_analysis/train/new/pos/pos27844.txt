I ordered this comforter for my 22 old baby. It is seemingly of qood quality, nicely filled with soft down-like material and is warm. It is washable which is a big plus. My only (minor) complaint is that this comforter is stiff and loud. Any movement causes a loud noise from this comforter and the baby wakes up. Hence my baby refuses to use it.
