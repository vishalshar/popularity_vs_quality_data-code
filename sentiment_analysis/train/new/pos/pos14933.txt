My baby has refused every kind of bottle we have tried. Returning to work after baby is hard enough add to that your baby won't eat the entire time your away. It was terrible for everyone. So many tears shed, so much stress. He was screaming every time I got to daycare to feed/pick him up. My son has started taking this bottle at 3 months. He still struggles with it a bit but he is actually able to suck on it and eat. Hallelujah!! However I think the nipple flow is too fast so I will be purchasing the newborn nipple.
