I already own a sling and a Snugli front/back carrier, but I was looking for something that I could COMFORTABLY carry our son on my hip... I bought a Lillebaby Everywhere but there were SO many clasps and straps... I needed the girl in the store to help me try to figure it out, and even she had a hard time!  I was searching the websites for Buy Buy Baby and Babies R Us to see what all was out there, and saw the Scootababy... it was the only hip carrier that carried my baby up higher instead of down on my lower hip/thigh.  After reading the actual Scootababy website, I ordered it on Amazon (our local stores didn't have the print that I wanted).  It arrived yesterday and it is a GODSEND.  Our son had eye surgery yesterday morning and wanted to be held all day and my husband had to work.  UPS delivered it and it took me LITERALLY 15 SECONDS to get it on and my son in it!  AND after wearing it all day... NO DISCOMFORT.  He loved being so close... he even slept in it... I only took him out of it to change his diaper and feed him.  I'm the first of my friends to have a baby so I will DEFINITELY be recommending this to EVERYONE I know!  LOVE IT!!!!!
