I like that this cup is safe, but we are not using it for water. It's hard enough to teach little babies to drink out of a cup instead of using a sippy cup, but this is so soft that it wiggles and it is just way beyond their motor skill development. Because it's not plastic, we will keep it, but we are only using it to hold snacks.
