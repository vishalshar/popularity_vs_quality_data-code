We only have one doorway this works on in our house but it's a life saver for those moments baby doesn't want to crawl around or sit and play. We have it set up between our dining/craft area and kitchen so baby can still interact with her sister and so she can see me while cooking and cleaning in the kitchen. When we go to my in.laws house we attach it to one of the many trees and let her bounce around while we hang out outside.
