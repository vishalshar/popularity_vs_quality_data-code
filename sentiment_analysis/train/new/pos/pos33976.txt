If you produce enough milk to leak,  at all, these things are a miracle! I just had my second child and just like with my first I am leaking through EVERYTHING on one side while I nurse on the other. I found these nursing cups looking for a milk catcher so I could stop changing my top half at every feeding. My order arrived yesterday just in time for me to leave the house. I put them on instead of a pad and caught a full ounce of milk from my leaking between feedings! What a waste it would have been if I'd bed wearing a regular nursing pad.Cons: a tad odd looking shape worn under your cloths. But I found the wearing a shaped bra or extra pad insert heels it look more normal. Can Only Hold about three fourths an ounce. So if you leak more than that you'll need to pull it out and dump it or switch it out for the other one before it starts leaking all over youThe photo as what I collected it just from leaking over the past 3 weeks
