We had the Chicco travel system for baby number one and it was one of baby purchases that didn't get much use because we also bought a BOB jogging stroller for outdoor activities and an Uppa Baby G Luxe stroller for travel and everyday use (which are both pricey but two of the best and most used items purchased).I knew I wanted a Caddy this time around for use with my Chicco car seat. Best choice ever!Pros:-Super light weight, portable, and quick/easy set up.-The storage compartment under the stroller is pretty large. I can put about 4-6 full bags of groceries underneath the stroller. My 4 year old 30 lb son occasionally catches a ride underneath and he seems comfortable.-Sturdy. I have this stroller 6 months now and it still looks great and holding up well after daily use from both my son and daughter.-Small footprint. Small and compact. Not bulky like most travel system strollers and gets the job done.-Handles well for errands like grocery store and the like. Remember, this isn't meant to be an all terrain stroller. If you keep that in mind, you won't be disappointed!-Easy snap on/off system that works with only Chicco car seat.-Safety. The car seat is locked in place with a click and no chance of falling off the Caddy.Cons:-A bit pricey for a piece of baby equipment that will only be used for as long as the infant car seat is used (year at best). I think this would-Not the smoothest ride for long walks and I wouldn't recommend for rough terrain (similar ride to a travel system stroller). With this being said, I am a little bias because I have my BOB stroller for these type of activities and I love it! Please don't get me wrong, this stroller is adequate for everyday use and performs well.Bottom line:Skip the travel system and buy a Stroller Caddy. Save your money for a nice stroller that fits your lifestyle and family.
