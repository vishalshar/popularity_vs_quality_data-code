Love these towels and wash cloths. I had received some carter's wash cloths - which were a cotton/polyester mix - and let's just say they were rough.  You don't want to give your baby a bath with some rough wash cloths.  These are 100% cotton and very soft and plush.  Love them and my son loves taking baths!  I would not recommend the green one - the frog leaf sticks out of the hood and my son does not like it on his head.  Love the yellow hooded towel.
