As a first time Mom, I had no idea what to look for in a pump. I bought this one on a whim and was honestly surprised. So much so, I bought one for my sister an I just bought it AGAIN for my second daughter! [I had accidentally left mine behind during a move]This pump is not intimidating and is incredibly easy to use. The battery last a really long time, and the unit is very easy to clean. It's a little loud at first, but you don't notice it after you get used to it. There are enough settings that everyone should be able to find one that suits them. As a more well endowed woman, I was also pleased that the shield was big enough to pump without pain. I also enjoyed that you have the option to use it with an AC adapter so you can save the battery for on-the-go. The bag is also adorable and not bulky or obvious.
