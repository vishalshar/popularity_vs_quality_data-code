I am about to have my fourth child and we've used all different cups. This is the least expensive and best against leaks that we have evvvver used. I just not found them and can't believe I didn't try them sooner. I thought since they were the cheapest, the would be crap. I always saw them in the bins at Walmart under all the other cups and ignored them. Then after losing tons and tons of cups I decided to try them.They do not leak on slow flow side. Easier to clean than any other cup. Has a fast flow option on the stopper valve.Perfect 10
