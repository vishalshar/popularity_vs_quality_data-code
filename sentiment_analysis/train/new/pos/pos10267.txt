I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL SAINT BERNARDS. THEY ARE OUR BABIES. I MADE MY OWN BEDS THE SIZE OF A BABY'S CRIB MATTRESS AND NEEDED SOME KIND OF COVERS FOR THEM. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THESE HOLD UP VERY WELL. THIS IS MY SECOND SET. I RECENTLY PURCHASED THEM BACK IN JUNE OF 2010 AND I JUST RECENTLY ORDERED ANOTHER 4 MORE. I LOVE THEM THEY PROTECT THE MATTRESS THAT THEY LAY ON ALL DAY AND WITH SAINT BERNARDS THEY ARE VERY HEAVY AND HAVE STRONG NAILS. THESE ARE THE BEST. THANKS
