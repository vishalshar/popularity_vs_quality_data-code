My daughter bought this for her newborn son before he arrived.  We wondered if it would be too big for him as a newborn, but answers from a couple of reviewers led us to believe its size would be fine.  It is important that baby accepts it because once he does, no other shaped pacifier nipple will be accepted.. NONE!She loves the skull and crossbones design, which is what attracted her to it initially and I liked the design of the nipple and the latex material it's made of, which allows you to see through it for any accumulation of water after sterilizing.Very nice item, well liked by all who see it and most important is the fantastic job it does for baby.
