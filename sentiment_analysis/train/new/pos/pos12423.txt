After much research, we bought this potty for our 9 month old son, knowing that potty training was just around the corner. I wasn't sure what to expect since it was only $14.95 and I was worried about the splash-guard. We haven't been able to find a potty with a good splash-guard. This potty has been great! We haven't had any problems with any fluids going anywhere except in the potty. And it's easy to empty and clean. I love that it's only one piece and sturdy so we don't have to worry about him tipping over. And the fact that the bowl is smooth means that his little bottom doesn't get red marks on it.The one thing that I would say is that it's a bit small. My 9 month old sits on it just fine, but even he is going to outgrow it pretty quickly. I'm not sure if this is just meant to be a very short-term potty. I'd love to see the company make them just a little bit bigger.Overall, I would still recommend this potty to anyone who is looking for one. :)
