My daughter is a tummy sleeper, heavy wetter, sleeps for 12+ hours. These help to make sure there is no leaks/moisture on her pjs in the AM. They are a higher quality than Gerber plastic pants as they don't break down with use. These are easy to wash in the washing machine with other whites and then hang to dry. I've even dried a few in the dryer (on accident) and they survived without any damage. I would highly recommend (we've been using this size from 17-21 lbs and they still fit well on my daughter). I've never seen these in stores so I think Amazon is your best bet to buy them.
