My husband and I have used this same sort of product from the One Step Ahead catalog and we actually like this brand better. We just bought 4 covers (2 packs) of this Jolly Jumper for our brand new Dodge Grand Caravan. We have one set on the rear of the front seats and the other set is on the rear of the 2nd row bucket seats.These are made of that thick clear plastic that you often see pricey bedding sets packaged inside. In other words, it's tough to rip. The covers are trimmed in a two-sided piping type of material (black). The top of the cover ties onto the head rest metal lift bars with ties like shoelaces (also black). The bottom of the seat cover is held in place by an elastic band that you slip down over the seat back (black elastic). The covers do come with optional sticky things that you could further affix the covers to the seat backs. We have not done this as we do not want sticky residue on our new van. So, sorry I cannot comment on whether or not the stickers are effective. Without the stickers, we feel confident in the covers' ability to ward off dirty shoes and other gunk. As long as your kids don't untie the top shoelaces ties the cover stays in place.I'm not worried about this product for the cost and that 2 come per pack. It's easy and cheap to replace if I ever needed to.
