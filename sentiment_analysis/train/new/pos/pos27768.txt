This swing arrived quickly and when I took it out of the box I knew right away that I would love it. It has great features to it that is hard to find in other swings. I love the quiet motor and the melodies. The fabric in the seat is very very soft and it made me wish I was a baby again just so I could sleep in it. There isnt anything wrong with this product and I was able to easily put it together in less then 5 minutes.
