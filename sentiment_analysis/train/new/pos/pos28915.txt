I'm a new mom and purchased two diaper bags prior to this one.  I returned the others and ordered this bag based on all of the great reviews.  thank you ladies for all that you said you loved about this bag!I have a 4-week old and this bag holds everything I need for my son plus my own stuff with room to spare!it seems to be well-made and it looks good! (I didn't want to have a diaper bag that looked like a diaper bag).it is comfortable on the shoulder and also hangs on my stroller without getting in my way.very happy I chose this bag!
