When I bought this I did so expecting it to work with the standard outlets my house, unfortunately they were not compatible.  The first picture attached is the type of outlets in my house, the second is the type of outlets this item works with.  This cover has the crossbar with screw hole.  Fortunately, I was able to cut the cover (with a Dremel tool) and drill two new holes to make it comparable.  After modification, I really like functionality of this cover.
