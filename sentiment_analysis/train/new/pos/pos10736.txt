I purchased the green pouch first, my dog ate them all then I ordered the Squooshi packets because my friend recommended them.  I love the disposable packets for going out, but at home I prefer the reusable. Here is my review of both.  I am using them with 14 month old twins.  Both pouches are reasonably priced and came quickly.Squooshi pros and cons:pros:  cute design, babies were able to get most of the food out on their own, easily washable, available in multiple sizescons:  not dishwasher safe (does not say either way on the package or instruction, so i'm guessing no), does not stand up on its own (harder to fill), the sizes are small- 4.5 oz and 2.5.  The smallest isn't even as big as the smallest disposable pouch, no measuring linesI haven't decided if the zipper on the bottom as opposed to the top is a pro or con.  So far I haven't had an issue with the bottom leakinggreen pouchpros:  zipper on top, stands up on its own, larger size, sturdier pouches, measuring lines at 2, 4 and 6 ozcons:  babies needed more help getting all the food out, square design leaves more food in the bag when done, only available in one size.  Cleaning is the biggest con for me.  They are dishwasher safe, but I found that the dishwasher alone does not clean them well. Food also got caught in the bottom crevices, between the sides and the bottom.  They say to use a bottle brush for the "pesky bits", but even that didn't reach all the food.  To properly clean them, I had to take a skewer and a paper towel and shove it down in the crevice to wipe it out.  After 3 weeks of use, the zipper separated from the sides.  They are supposed to last a few months.all in all, I think I will buy the squooshi pouches again.  They both get four stars from me because there are features of the other that I like, but as far as ease of use for the babies (who I bought them for), I think the squooshi is preferable.
