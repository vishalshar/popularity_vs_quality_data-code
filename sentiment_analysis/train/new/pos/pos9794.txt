My son only drinks milk so we've been through Many sippy cups. These are the best sippy cups I've found. I love how they lock into place but if you have the straw in place when you close the lid then the milk will spill out. Make sure the straw isn't in the top when you close the sippy cup. Once you put the straw in the sippy cup you can slip the straw in slowly and the milk won't come out and get all messy. When my son first used these cups, it was hard for him to drink out of them because since the cup is locked so tight and no air can get in, it creates like a suction and his tongue would get stuck to the straw. I easily solved that problem by heating a needle and poking a small hole on the top by the straw. There is actually 2 hole indents on the top by the straw that makes it easy to see where the hole should go. I poked the hot needle through one of the holes and it fixed the problem.
