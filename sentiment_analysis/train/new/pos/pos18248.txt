Soooo easy to maneuver!  We have a 1 year old and a 3 year old. When our daughter was born, we bought a sit n stand, which was good because you could attach a car seat to it if necessary & the upper bucket seat was just the right size for a little baby once she could hold her head up a little. But now that both kids are toddlers, the sit n stand isn't what we need. I use strollers to walk to town or pace the street for nap time. With the sit n stand, the chairs barely recline and the seats are pretty small for a 3 year old, plus the tires are plastic so walking on the grass is extremely difficult and hard on the wrists.  With this big Baby Trend stroller, off-roading is easy and the seats are huge!  Plenty of room for two toddlers. AND the seats recline so far back that they are almost lying flat like a bed, making nap time very easy.  Such a good price for a double stroller, no idea why you would ever buy a more expensive one...there's no way a $400 stroller could be that much better.  Oh one more random thing, it comes with a spot to plug in your phone or iPod to listen to music, but the speaker is pretty weak so it's quiet...you are better off just listening to it through the phone itself without plugging it in....but that's not why I bought the stroller anyways, it's just an extra feature they added to look cool I guess.  Overall, great stroller, easy to put together, easy to maneuver, shade moves to block the sun, kids love it, would buy it again in a heart beat.  A+++
