Fabulous!  I LOVE these short bibs because I can leave them on my baby all day long as he drools, and it keeps his chest dry.  The problem with longer bibs is that when he plays they get in his face and mouth and it seems unsafe (suffocation hazard), so these are perfect.  They are very absorbent and are great in the wash.  They good be slightly softer, but for a cheap price, it makes sense that they are the material that they are.  I highly recommend these as a safe bib for baby to wear all day long.
