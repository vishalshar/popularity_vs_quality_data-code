These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands).  I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack.  I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns.  My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with "MONKEY BOY" or "POWER DROOLER" all over them.  They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials.  To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars.  You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby.  Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin.  Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin.  Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.
