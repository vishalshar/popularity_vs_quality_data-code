I bought this product over four years ago. I love the wooden build and easy to clean cover. It attaches easliy and securely to our kitchen chairs. When the child was younger we used the added height of the legs and when he was older we folded the legs under took off the tray and moved the child right up to the table. There were times we sat on the ground for picnics and this chair was awesome. VERY stable even with a wiggler.This booster chair is on the third child!
