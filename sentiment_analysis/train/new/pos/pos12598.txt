This bank is so cute!  It arrived in perfect condition and was bigger than I thought it would be.  Holds well over $200 in dimes nickles and quarters.  It was really heavy when filled too.  Loved that I could write Mia's name and birthdate on it.  Was the perfect first bank.  She will now get a filled piggy bank every year on her birthday. Got to love starting new traditions.
