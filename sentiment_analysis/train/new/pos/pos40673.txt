I bought this to go on a Davinci Kailani convertible crib. I particularly wanted rail covers without string ties because my little one would tear that apart in no time flat. I like that the Velcro closure is neat and leaves nothing for a baby to pull on. I installed them out of the package to be sure it fit before washing and drying, and it was an exact fit. After washing and drying there was NO shrinkage which was impressive. The padding is just right and enough to protect the wood without being too bulky. The brown is a perfect match to the Espresso crib color which I like because it blends in and gives more flexibility with bedding colors and room decor.
