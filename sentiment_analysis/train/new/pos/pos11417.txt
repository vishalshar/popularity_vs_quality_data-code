SO stoked.  I hacked these silicone sealing discs by punching a hole (with a standard paper hole punch) for a straw to fit thru. PERFECT size for thin straws. We use these everyday for my toddlers water and they're so fab my 6 yr old wants to use them as well. THANK YOU Pura for solving my year-long search for the perfect sippy/straw cup!!
