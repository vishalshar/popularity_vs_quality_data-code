I have twins that were exclusively breastfed for the first 3 months, and then given bottles when i had to go back to work full-time (though I still nurse them whenever I'm home).  A lot of literature out there says that the best nipples for breastfed babies have a large base (unlike these) but I really think it's depends on the baby.  Both of mine hated the Playtex Natural Latch ones that I tried initially even though my older daughter loved them when she was a baby.  Since I wanted to switch to glass bottles anyway, I decided to give Lifefactory a try and surprisingly the twins were fine with it.  It does look a little funny because the entire nipple disappears into their mouths so their lips touch the white ring cap but they seem happy so I can't argue.  The most important thing for me was that using these nipples has not impacted the way they latch on me at all.  However, like I mentioned before, I think it's very baby-specific so you won't know until you try.I've been using the nipples for 4 months now and they've held up great.  Right after using, I simply throw them in a stainless steel bowl filled with soapy hot water, soak them for 15-30 minutes and the're good to go after rinsing. If I wait too long after feeding them to throw them in the water they sometimes have a little bit of residue but that's easily cleaned using a nipple brush.
