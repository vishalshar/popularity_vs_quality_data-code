After my baby decided he preferred to sleep stretched out over being swaddled, I started looking for something with long sleeves that would allow him to have his arms free, but would still be easy to change his diapers at night.  First, it was very difficult to find something with long sleeves and warm material.  Because of the price, I shopped around for a while without much luck and skeptically ordered 2 of these.  I kept looking around for a less expensive option and found some at target for 1/3 the price.  I contemplated returing the Summer Infant ones to amazon, but decided we could probably use the extras.  The price difference is evidenced by the softer material, the zipper that can zip from top or bottom, the optional mittens, and the lack of a button at the top (there is just extra fabric to cover the zipper pull).  I use both sleep sacks, but certainly prefer these Summer Infant ones, despite the hefty price tag, which isn't bad if you compare it to the price of a baby blanket, which is essentially what this is.  I bought the 0-6 month size, which is HUGE on my 6 week old, but with the high quality material and construction, I'm sure they will last him that long.  Overall, this is a great buy!
