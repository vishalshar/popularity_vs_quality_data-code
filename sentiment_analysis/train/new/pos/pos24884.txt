I bought this for my toy chest for for grandchildren. I was looking for the original chime ball to create a collection of toys my grandchildren's parents played with.  I was unhappy with the condition of the old ones,and settled for this one.  I love the rainforest these,and am happy with the toy, as is the baby.  The only drawback is that the original ball with the rocking horses was much more interesting because it would roll all the way over.  The leaves on this ball prevent it from getting away.  The sound is awesome.
