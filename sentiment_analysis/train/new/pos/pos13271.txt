I cannot rave about this product enough. We have used it for parades, trips to parks and zoos, amusement parks, etc. It provides a really nice shade for the baby, making it possible for him to sleep no matter where we are and to keep the sun off of him. For a parent with skin cancer in the family, being able to have a level of control for sun exposure is a huge relief. We do use sun screen even with using the shade because there are spaces between the stroller and the shade in some areas, but my son has not gotten so much as a tan while under the shade. This is one of my favorite "baby gear" purchases and I most definitely recommend it, especially for a family that loves to be outdoors
