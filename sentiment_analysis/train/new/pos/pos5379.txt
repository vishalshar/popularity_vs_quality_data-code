The product is great.  We ordered both the front and side rails.  We have the exact same crib in the picture...and the covers for the front rail fit very snuggly.  The problem with the side rails is they do not fit unless your side rails are the same size and shape as the front rail.  Our side rails (which you cannot see in this picture) are about 1" wide and 4" tall.  They are not curved like the front rail.  As a result, we have to send these back and figure something else out.  Just something to be aware of if you plan to purchase the set.
