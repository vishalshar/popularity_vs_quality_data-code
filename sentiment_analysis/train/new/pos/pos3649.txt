This review is for the Navigator as a double stroller:My kids are 4 months and 2 years old. Before the little one was born, I did not really want to buy a double stroller because I already found the single one I had too big. But once he was there, I knew I needed a double because I walk a lot with both kids. I ordered a side-by-side one first, but it did not fit in the elevator in our building. Therefore I returned it and bought this one instead and I love it! It is actually smaller than the single one I had for my daughter. It is easy to navigate and I like that it has a hand brake because foot brakes tend to ruin your shoes. I also love that you can convert one of the seats into a bassinet. We have used it this way most of the time so far.There are a couple of things that I do NOT love about the stroller:- It is quite heavy. I usually let my husband put it in the car. BUT if they used lighter material, the stroller would probably be much more expensive.- I used to hang my diaper bag on the handle bar of my old stroller. You cannot really do that with this one because the bag will be in your baby's face or at least block his view.- There is not much room in the basket, especially when using it with two seats.BUT the last two issues just come with a double stroller that is the size of a single.So all in all I am super happy with this stroller and I gave it five stars because there is no other double stroller on the market that is as small and inexpensive as this one.Here are a couple of things we found out after we bought the stroller that can save you some money:- The second seat is already included. So you don't have to buy an extra seat.- We were going to buy the Phil&Teds cocoon for our newborn to put him in the bassinet. But when we got the stroller we realized that we would not need it. So we ended up not buying it.
