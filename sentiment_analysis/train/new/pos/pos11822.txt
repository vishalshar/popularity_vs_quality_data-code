The only reason that I gave this four stars is because three of the buttons can be activated by push. The yellow is supposed to be a turn to open, but if it's at the right spot, you can just push on the yellow button and it will pop up. Someone had reviewed this and cautioned parents about their child getting hurt. I read the review and wondered how that could possibly happen, it sounds impossible? When when I got the item I started feeling around inside and realised what must have happened.While the pop-up is opening there is a space between the bottom of the animal and the white area of the toy on the top. If you feel around in there, there are a couple of sharp corners (that serve what purpose I couldn't tell you). So, if a kid opened this toy, then started to depress the animal to close it and got their finger inside on accident, but then didn't close it all the way, their finger could get stuck in between the bottom of the animal and the white part of the toy as it popped back up again, and as it's sharp, yeah it's definitely possible for an injury to occur.Overall, it's a great toy, just keep in mind that younger babies probably need to be supervised while using this.
