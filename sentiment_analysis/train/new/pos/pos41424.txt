Got this because I was tiered of my 1yr old daughter dumping her food all over the floor all the time. She also like to walk around with her bowl of snacks shaking it to see where all the food would go. Her personal favorite would be to turn her bowl upside down in front of the dogs.I needed a way to outsmart my 1 yr old, so I bought this product along with some suction bottom bowls. This flower snack keeper helps keep all the little cereal and snacks inside without going all over my floor. I like that there is two handles for her to grab, and the silicone top is just stiff enough that the snacks don't fly out when she shakes it, yet she can still pull her hand in and out of it with ease.We have had this product for 6 months now, and she has finally discovered a way to outsmart me- Again. She learned she can lift one of the orange silicone wedges up, and turn the cup upside-down, then shake it, which consequently does get snacks all over my floor, but that is only on very "special" days. You know, the same days your toddler thinks it's funny to pull everything off every single shelf, throw things in the fish bowl to see if the fish will eat it, and draw all over your favorite pair of shoes?!Overall, I would give this product 5 stars. It does what it says, and is much cuter than the other bland brands. Wish they made the flower in different colors, so we could buy a couple and know what snack is in which one.
