I was skeptical about these after reading the mixed reviews. These mittens are made of a soft flannel and have thicker cotton wrist bands instead of the typical elastic found in your average scratch mitten. The thick cotton wrist sets these mittens apart from the others because these mittens actually stay on and my newbie is a little crazy about rubbing/scratching her face and head when she wants to eat. Second, there isn't any elastic to irritate bavy's delicate skin. The thicker cotton wrists makes it slightly more difficult to get these on the baby, especially if there is a moving target. I solved the problem by putting my newborn's hand in a fist and quickly slipping the mittens over and that is it! I also wash these inside out and dry in the dryer on low delicate cycle to prevent the flannel from pilling. They shrink a little in the wash but can easily be stretched out and it beats air drying as suggested!
