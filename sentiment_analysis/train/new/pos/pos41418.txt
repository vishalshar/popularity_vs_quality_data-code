The growth chart is very colorful and well made.  But what I didn't realize when ordering this product is that it's made of terrycloth; you can't write on it (unless possibly you try a permanent marker).  I thought it was made of paper, so you could write on it, but it had pockets for the photos as well.  It's really only good for taking pictures of your child standing next to it, and putting the pictures in the frames.  I hung it up and took my daughter's picture, but I think the numbers are too small to see in the picture.  I'm considering finding someone to sew the dates on the growth chart sometime in the future.It's lovely, just not what I was expecting.
