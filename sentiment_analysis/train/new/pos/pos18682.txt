Very cute and simple. This is just what I was looking for. I did not want anything bulky that would be cumbersome to carry around. Perfect to take to indoor sleepover parties. It is not suitable for sleeping outside at night. It is ok to take outside in the summer to hang out inside of a tent but it is not weather proof by any means. It is very thin. My daughter often uses this all over the house, just to hang out and read a book or do something quiet on the floor. It doesn't come with a pillow but the bag is pretty roomy and will fit one of those small square pillows inside of it. It is easy to wash. The bag is washable as well. The eye mask was a nice plus.
