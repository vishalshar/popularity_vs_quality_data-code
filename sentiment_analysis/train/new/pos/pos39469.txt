I have a VERY active 6-month-old who's actually not showing signs of teeth yet. Still, he puts EVERYTHING in his mouth. This is a great pendant that's safe for baby, comfortable and fashionable for mama.I specifically wanted a bright necklace to help keep my son's hands and fingers busy, and not the kind that has beads the full length of the necklace (I've heard they pull on hair--ouch!). And I wanted something attractive--not cartoony (think the Flintstones) and obviously made for a baby. This necklace fits my sense of style because it looks like something I'd wear anyway. The breakaway clasp makes it easy for my 6-month-old to yank it off my neck when he really tries, and he just as often sucks on the cord as he does the pendant (he's not truly teething yet). The clasp doesn't bother me, but I always watch to make sure the cord doesn't end up endangering him in any way.We'll see whether the pendant continues to capture his interest when he's truly teething! I may shop for another necklace that has multiple beads which may provide interesting texture for him.
