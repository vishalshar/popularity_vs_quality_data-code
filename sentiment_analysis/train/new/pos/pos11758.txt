I was looking for a tall but narrow hamper for an already cramped bedroom and it turns out there are very few modern choices. Standards now seem to be square or round, neither of which fit into the 'low-profile' category. Luckily I remember this style from growing up with the heavy-duty versions  in our home. It's under $50, looks relatively nice with the natural wicker weave exterior, and only projects about a foot from the wall. Works for me.This modern version is not quite as sturdy as the old-timey ones, being reinforced with plastic u-channel instead of wood, but so far it's holding up just fine. As stated the natural weave looks good. The plasticky border could be less bargain-looking, but hey it's a bargain!There is no removable linen liner like many of the more modern designs include, which would be nice for lifting the clothes out and running down to the washer like a cat burglar with no sense of direction. But alas you are left with the option of transferring the dirty clothes to a separate laundry basket or bag, or hauling the entire unit to the laundry room. Luckily, the lightweight construction of the hamper make the second option viable if carrying furniture is your thing.A full hamper holds approximately two loads of laundry, usually a good indicator that it's time to do the work before those gym socks in the bottom crawl out and declare themselves emancipated.Overall, I'd say it's a great value considering the competition. If you're trying to match your Ikea decor, you may be out of luck, but if you have a retro-streak or just a wood furniture based style, the Burlington may be the best way to hide your dirty underwear.
