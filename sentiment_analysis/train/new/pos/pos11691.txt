Our Pearhead growth chart arrived today - the material is nice, the giraffe design is adorable, and I appreciate that they include the pen and paint for marking height and hand prints. I also liked the way it was packaged nicely - I felt like it was "gift ready" and not just thrown in a box for shipping.The sewn twill along the edges of the chart is a bit wrinkled/not-flat along the edges and we have hung it up and it doesn't stay perfectly flat against the wall. I may try gently ironing it a bit and/or spritzing with water and hoping gravity will flatten it out more completely. It isn't that bad though, and I am still quite happy with it in its current state.One other challenge with the chart is that the numbers aren't exactly scientific, for example, we held it up to a tape measure and made sure the 2 ft mark was exactly 2 ft from the ground, but then if you go on up the chart by the time you reach the 5ft mark it is about 1 inch or more off - this may in part be a side effect of the wrinkling. I kind if wish they would have left the numbers off entirely if they weren't going to be more accurate.Never-the-less, it is a beautifully made growth chart and I am quite pleased with it.
