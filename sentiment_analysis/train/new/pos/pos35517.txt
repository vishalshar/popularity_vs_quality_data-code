I recently took a trip with my two-year-old daughter, and in preparation for leaving I bought this car seat dolly essentially.  I had to bring a car seat with us as the airline website made it seem like if I did not have a seat for her essentially should be strapped in her seat with a cargo harness, but also  we would need it upon arrival as well; and I was worried about it getting lost or damaged in transit if I checked it.  It was actually very easy to use, the only hard part was having to take it apart for security, and also getting on and off the plane. (As there's no way there's room to wheel the seat onto the aircraft, it must be taken apart on the ramp and carried on. I did develop a system on our return flights where I put the collapsed dolly into the seat, and just carried the seat on like that.)  However, the flight attendants were great helping me if I needed it.  It was great to have her seat with us, as she seemed to sleep more comfortably in it than if she was just strapped into the plane seat with a belt.  And most the time through the airport she was still in her seat strapped in while I pushed her around as if she was in a stroller.  I did get several other compliments and questions about it from other parents are also travelling with their small children who thought it was something they wished they are known about.  I also looked into the strap you can buy that you just use to attach your seat to your role around carry on suitcase.  For me that would not have worked because then on top of a two-year-old and a car seat to finagle on and off the aircraft (dolly sitting inside the seat); I would have then also had the roll around suitcase to deal with as well.  That would've been too much, so this worked out really well for our trip.
