This light fixture plate is all it was said to be. I ordered it because I am fixing my 2 (1 on the way) grandsons bedroom up with Disney Cars and this was just an added feature. The only problem I ran into was the screws that came with the light switch plate were to fat to fit into the socket fixture which was  not fault of Amazon. I just used the screws that were original in the fixture and everything worked out just perfect. I would recommmend anyone who is fixing up a kids room with Disney Cars to order this. Added features accents the room. Very pretty product.
