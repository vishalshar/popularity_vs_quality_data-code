This is a GREAT little Travel bed! I had a similar one back in the 80's and I never left home without it. I have been looking for one like I had, for my daughter's new baby, and this is very similar in style and portability, but has a lot of improvements over mine. IT COMES with a sheet!!! (although any bassinet sheet will fit too). It has the little toy arch, it has little ventilation windows which I think is much better than the big mesh sides that some of the portable beds have (keeps it still private and quiet so baby isn't distracted by goings on around him as much, yet there is good airflow too). Nice neutral colors...and big and roomy, bigger than the one I had. It also doubles as a changing table. If you feel like sitting under a tree in the park, or stopping at a friend's house, there is always a clean, safe place to let your baby take a nap or to change it diaper right next to you. Then fold it up, throw the strap over your shoulder and off you go. You can even stuff a few diapers, a recieving blanket and some baby wipes inside of it and get by without a diaper bag for short visits. No "on the move" mom should be without one of these!
