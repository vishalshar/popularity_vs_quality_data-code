I did TONS of research on the previous model, Kolcraft Contours Tandem, and I loved everything about it.  So I was ready to buy the original model used from someone but then I found that they had a NEW model and had improved all the minor things that some of the ladies complained about the first model (canopy not tall enough, seats not deep enough, no cup holders for toddlers, etc.)  So I couldn't bring myself to get the older model when the new model had fixed all the things that people wanted changed from the first model!  But since it was a new model I would never be able to find it used...so I gave in and bought it new and WOW I love it!  The wheels are my favorite part, super smooth and the front wheels turn on a dime!  You have a million options for switching the seats and customizing them to your toddler or infant, this stroller is a dream come true for me.  TONS of storage underneath also!  I have no complaints, I love this stroller!
