I'm a first time mom, of a big (not fat) but long and solid baby boy.  We originally had him in a bouncer when he was a newborn.  Had I realized that our baby would grow so fast and weigh so much by 4 months of age, I would have purchased this rocker instead.  It holds a whopping 40 lbs!  Our son weighs 20 lbs and he's 4 months old.  Our traditional bouncer (Fisher Price Little Lambs Collection)-- hold only 25 lbs, as most do.  So this rocker could have saved us a good $80 if we would have bought this instead.  I love how brightly colored the rocker is.  Our son never grabs a hold of toys, but when he's in this rocker he loves grabbing the toys on the toy bar (which can easily be removed for getting baby in and out.)  Our baby is long-- and he loves to kick, so when he's in his bouncer it usually hit his feet, but in this rocker he can kick all he wants and he won't get hurt at all.  I love how you can either put baby in the A. Rocking position/ or B. Stationary position.  This way you can use it for your newborn as well and keep a infant positioner in the rocker under them to keep them nice and snug.  The rocker also vibrates which is a plus.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a bouncer that will hold a solid baby, something they won't grow out of right away (and can be used as a chair when they're a toddler)-- then you definitely should buy this rocker.  It's a life saver for those moms who need to keep baby occupied so they can take a nice relaxing shower.  Just keep the rocker in stationary position right in the bathroom with you-- and baby will stay nice and content while Mommy takes some time for herself.  :)
