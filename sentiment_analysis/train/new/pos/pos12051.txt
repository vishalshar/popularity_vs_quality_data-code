I had registered for this thermometer and received it through another website.  I wanted to get another thermometer because I have heard that the ones that come with the baby health kits aren't very good. So far its working as expected.  We've tried it both under the arm and rectally and have gotten consistent readings.  I like how fast the reading takes (works well with a squirmy baby) and I like the color coding (green, yellow, and red).I am able to review this on Amazon because I purchased another one for my sister after she registered for it on her Amazon Baby Registry.  I was surprised when I saw that the thermometer got such bad reviews here.  I saw that most of the bad reviews had to do with the battery life (thanks reviewers) so I took tips off the other reviews and bought back up batteries for my sister and myself.  I bought CR1225 Renata Watch Batteries as recommended by a vendor for all Vicks thermometers.  I was looking at the Energizer batteries, read the bad reviews regarding using them on Vicks thermometers and saw the response from one of the vendors and their recommendations to use the Renata ones.I haven't had to use any back up batteries yet but have only been using it for about 4 months now (saw that the batteries died for some around 6 months).  I have used it probably around 10 times in the 4 months though.  If my opinion on this thermometer changes the longer I use it, I'll update this review.  But so far, I've had no problems with it.
