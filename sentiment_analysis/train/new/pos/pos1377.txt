First of all, we have a toilet that does not have a back to it. It's a modern design without the tank part on the back.We've had the toilet lock for a year and a half now & it's worked beautifully. I've had to explain it to a number of guests, but that's a small price for knowing my son is safe & not having toys thrown down the toilet.I've found it to be sturdy (my son has pulled on it quite hard, but I've always stopped him immediately as I don't think he "should" be pulling on it. I've not noticed it making anything uneven & although my son could get his fingers in the gap by still pulling up on the seat a little, it was never enough to hurt him or that he could get something in the toilet.My only issue is I'm not sure how I'm going to get it off now that he's getting older. It's so secure I might be stuck with a child locked toilet forever.I would recommend this product.
