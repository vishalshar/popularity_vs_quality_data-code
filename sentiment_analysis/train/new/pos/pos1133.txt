exactly as described and i received one hell of a deal. there were no missing parts, pieces, or screws. the only down side is when i washed the bedding the ribbons for the piece that sits in the bassinet got stuck on the Velcro of the skirt.  it ended up with the ribbon essentially mangled. i have worked with fabric and ribbon before and knew well enough this was likely to happen before i washed it. its easily changeable and an easy color to match. also around the bottom of the bassinet where the skirt attaches, there is velcro that wraps around the bassinet. i plan on changing it with an industrial velcro. which is give and take because its usually tough to pull apart. also, on the top lip of the bassinet you can see the screws. i plan on filling it with wood filler and darkening with a wood marker.i had seen a post that implied they put the bassinet together and the fabric was wrinkled. its fabric. it wrinkles. but never should we put fabric and clothing for use without being washed thoroughly. fyi for parents. there are over 80k unregulated toxic chemicals in the us due to our polices and lack of regulations for larger companies. i'm not insinuating toxic chemicals are in the fabric, but its about being aware. products that are banned in the uk are sold in the us. baby products, nursing pillows, and even fragrance powders and lotions have toxic chemicals. big name companies have contributed to poisoning us. the only way they will change is either through policy or public pressure. these chemicals cause infertility, learning behaviors, stunted growth, and cancer causing chemical agents. flame retardants are typically used on pajamas, bedding, and curtains. as it stands right now we cannot escape the toxins. 100 newborns were recently tested for chemicals and each tested positive for toxic chemicals. be vigilant. wash items before use to minimize exposure. and make change happen!
