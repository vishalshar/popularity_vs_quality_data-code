Easter is my favorite holiday and I loved the idea of having a separate photo album just for the occasion. I wish it wasn't a silly purse album and was easier to put the photos into the sleeves but once they are in; they aren't going anywhere and are well protected.The toys were so cute!  I loved how each had a different effect (crinkle, rattle, peep). My daughter was a bit too young to really appreciate but I enjoyed showing them to her.
