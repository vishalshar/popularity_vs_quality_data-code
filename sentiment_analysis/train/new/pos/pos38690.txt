I absolutely love theIs item. I originally used it as a decoration for my son's baby shower but then later kept it as a vase for my sons room. It is made very well and for owl lovers like me, it's such a cute and fun decoration. I would highly recommend this item to anyone whether it be used a baby shower, gift, decoration, vase etc.
