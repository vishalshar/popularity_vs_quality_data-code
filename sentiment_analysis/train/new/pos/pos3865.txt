The bedding is nice, though a bit thin. I wish the comforter had a bit more substance, but pretty good otherwise. It fit my son's toddler bed (sheets, comforter, and shams), and has good coloration. He was excited when he received it and even RARRRR'd when he saw the dinosaurs.After having washed the bedding set, I haven't seen any discoloration, fraying, or shrinking. The comforter seems to keep its shape as well, though there isn't much padding to bunch up in certain spots.Overall, this is a good set, but it doesn't "wow". If you buy this, make sure you get a hearty RRRAAAARRRRRR from your little one! You likely won't be disappointed that you bought this set.
