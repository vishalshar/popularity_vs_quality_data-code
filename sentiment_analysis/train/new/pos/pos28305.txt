This is my favorite baby bottle-- used it with my first child and I'm currently using this bottle for my second child.  Definitely helps keep the baby from ingesting air. You can hear the air escaping out of the bottle, so there's proof that it works.  The only thing that bugs me are the pieces. Taking apart one bottle gives you 6 different pieces to wash.  After a while it's a bit of a hassle but the bottle is well worth it.  Also, I didn't get the option to pick the color I wanted. I just hoped they wouldn't send me a pink one, since I have boys. Luckily I got a white one and a blue one.
