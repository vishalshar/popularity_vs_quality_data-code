I bought these when preparing for air travel with our 3-month-old daughter. I didn't want to fill up the diaper bag with her regular bottles and have a ton of dishes to do when we arrived at our destination. These worked great! I packed Enfamil single-use formula packets, and bought a bottle of water after we passed through security. As others have mentioned the bottles can leak a little, but not bad enough to be a problem for us. Also, if your little one finishes what you mix and you want to add more, you're out of luck -- once the lid's on, it's on -- you'll have to use a new bottle. The flow is quite fast, so I chose the medium flow -- which is just as fast as the fast-flow nipples on her regular bottles. All in all, these were a great purchase and I will get them again for air travel, or even a long road trip.
