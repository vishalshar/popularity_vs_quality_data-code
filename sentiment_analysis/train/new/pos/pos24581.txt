This cup works great. No valves or gaskets to remove for wasing. There is a very small permanent gasket on the lid that looks like it could wear out quickly, but we have used the cup for a while and it is still fine. My 20 month old drinks from it without any problem. the cup does not lead unless the lid is not on correctly. We have 2 in constant use.
