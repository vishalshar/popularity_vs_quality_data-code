I do not understand the negative reviews, though there are only a few. This is a three bottle tote, so you should not be surprised if you can't fit more than three bottles in it. I rely heavily on reviews and star ratings, and I hate it when someone leaves a negative review because they had unrealistic expectations for the product.Anyway, I find this tote to be very roomy. I use it to pack my baby's bottles for daycare, but I may order a second one for other uses. The stretchy material allows it to accommodate way more than I expected. The dividers are soft (photo 1), so you can just move them to the side if you don't want to use them. I haven't used the front pocket yet, but it would be perfect for pacifiers, snacks, a teething toy or a burp cloth. The strap is the perfect length to carry on your shoulder or in your hand. Plus it snaps apart (photo 2) so you can attach it to things like a carseat or stroller. I also love that the bag is washable!It's true that you would have to really stretch it to fit Dr. Brown's 8oz bottles with the vents/nipples/caps attached. However, they fit fine with the travel lids. I can fit up to 6 standard size bottles (photo 3) and the bag still zips up easily (photo 4). I can fit 4 wide neck 5oz bottles (photo 5) stacked 2 on bottom with travel lids and 2 on top with nipples/caps. One reviewer said they could only fit 2 Medela bottles, but I can easily fit 3 Medela 8oz (photo 6) or up to 5 Medela 5oz bottles if I stretch it. I most commonly use it to carry 3 Dr. Brown's 4oz bottles with travel lids and 3 sets of vents/nipples/caps (photo 7).
