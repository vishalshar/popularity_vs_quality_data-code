This cover was exactly what we needed.  We have a BOB stroller and needed a cover for a recent trip to Disney.  The weather report called for torrential downpours and it was spot on.  I didn't want to buy the official Bob cover because it was way over priced for our needs.  I was a little skeptical but the cover stood the test when the rains came.  It installed easily, our stuff stayed dry, and we got through the day.  What else can I say.  It was big enough for our toddler and 6 year old to comfortable fit under it.  I would highly recommend this product if you need a rain cover for a specific event.  It was perfect for our needs.
