Our son has been breastfed, but also LOVES his pacifiers.  When we bought this, he was 19 months old, and we were trying (and trying and trying and trying...) to reduce his dependence on the pacifier, but in the meantime, make it so he could more easily find the pacifier in the middle of the night.  This little "Lambie" (as we call it) has made all of our lives a little easier.  Now, at almost 2, my son asks for Lambie toward the end of our nighttime routine or after nursing.  He can find Lambie and put the pacifier back in his mouth quite easily (it's bigger and thus easier to find than a pacifier alone).  He holds onto Lambie, which makes me at least a little hopeful that eventually, he may be okay with just holding Lambie rather than having to have the pacifier.  It's a little expensive for what it is, but it really has helped us, so I'm glad we got it.
