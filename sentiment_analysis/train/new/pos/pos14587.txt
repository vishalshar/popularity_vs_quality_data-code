I ordered this cover after reading the reviews & decided to take a chance.  I have a really old high chair that was handed down by my in-laws.  The chair itself is a Graco Infant to Youth Highchair.  I went on Graco website & entered the model # and they did not have anything for sale. So I started to look for universal covers & took a chance on this one.  It totally paid off :)I love that the fabric is waterproof but not plastic.  The fact that its reversible is great because it makes u feel u have to new chairs.  The back part of the cover fits a little snug but it holds on. As for the side tides it has, I cant use them on my chair & they really are not needed.  The holes to let the safety belts are in the perfect spot. And the colors are really cute no matter if its a boy or girl.  (I have a baby boy).  I really recommend it.  If it wasn't for this cover I would have probably had to buy a new chair & for only a few buck go a great looking chair :)
