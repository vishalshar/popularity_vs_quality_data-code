I bought this car seat together with the uppababy Cruz and I'm so happy with my purchase. Perfect combination! They work great together.  Do not need and adapter for the Cruz.When my baby girl was born it made everything so easy for me, having a car seat that snaps on and off so easy was great. I never carried the heavy car seat with me, I just used my cruz! Amazing.I bought it with amazon in January 2014 and I arrived in 4 days.My baby is now 9 months old and loved this car seat every minute! She made a 18 hours trip to Orlando and she was very comfortable in it.Now she is 29 inches and she needs a new car seat, but she loved her car seat!Pros:- great quality fabric- base is the easiest latch installation I've seen.- car seat can be buckle in directly with easy instructions.- very easy to move between cars- no adapters for the Cruz and the work great together. Need adapter for the vista but is not a big deal.- very nice design and very sturdy car seat.Cons:- canopy makes a noise when opened that's wakes up my baby- I noticed she was hot during the summer in this car seatOverall I love this car seat, I will highly  recommend it!Reading some reviews I must say that ANY car seat is heavy with a baby in it. I tried many empty car seats before buying this one, and they are all almost the same weight. Of course the car seat will be heavy with a 5 month old in it. In my opinion every car seat is heavy with a baby in it. That's the nice thing about this car seat, that you can use it with uppababy CRUZ or VISTA. I personally bought the Cruz and I love it.
