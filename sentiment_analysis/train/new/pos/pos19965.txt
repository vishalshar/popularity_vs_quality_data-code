love this toy we have actually had this toy for about a year now and its still holding up strong we havent even had to replace the batteries yet haha! we did notice that when we got the toy in the mail there was no off switch but we have just recently figured out that if you act like your turn the tractor off with the key thats how it shuts off just a fyi for anyone who had the same problem
