I purchased this product three years ago when I was pregnant with my first daughter. I wore it daily during my pregnancy. After my daughter was born, she was soothed by the same music that I played using the belt. She is now almost three and is incredibly bright. She already shows musical abilities and is advanced in many areas for her age. I credit much of this to the power of music! I'm now preganant with my second daughter and recently brought the belt back out to use again. Unfortunately the speaker had broken, probably from improper storage. I contacted the company and they provided a free replacement speaker, no questions asked, three years after the original purchase. I only paid a small fee for shipping. I recommend the lullabelly to every expectant momma!
