I got this for my wife for out 25th wedding anniversary!  She loves giraffes andthe red heart shown on the outside can record a personal message.  Also thereis a Velcro opening in the back where you can place the heart up inside thestuffed animal.  When you push on the animal's heart a red light blinks thatcan be seen from the outside while the recording plays.  It is plenty loud enoughto be easily heard from the outside.  Although a heartbeat is a great idea thereis no need to limit it to just babies and heartbeats.  They can be used foranniversaries, Valentines day, birthdays etc.  A great product line with lotsof options!
