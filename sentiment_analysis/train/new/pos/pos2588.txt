Simple design with cute fabric, could be used for either sex, fits all carts easily, and with one hand...I like my baby to have a clean zone, while I do a quick shopping trip, my guy is very laid back and pateint so I am not concerned with using the safety straps, but it is easy enough to do, if you have a wiggly worm. After you use one hand the place the item in the cart, sit your child in the seat and buckle the safety strap around them, then snap the back buckle to the cart and velcro around leg straddle in center. (Easier than it sounds)When shopping is done, stroll cart to car, remove child and groceries into vehicle and then open straps and roll back into its bag.
