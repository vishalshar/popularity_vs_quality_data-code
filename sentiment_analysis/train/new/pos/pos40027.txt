There has been some confusion over whether the bowls/plates are microwave safe. When I was trying to decide whether or not to buy these, some reviews said they are NOT microwave-safe, and some said they ARE. I contacted the Munchkin customer service, and was told that the bowls and plates ARE microwave-safe. They're made of polypropylene. I went ahead and ordered two sets, and both the packaging, as well as the items themselves, clearly state "microwave-safe".I think that in past years, they did not say that anywhere, and that's where the confusion is coming from. But now, they do state it, and I also have the word straight from the company. So if this is a concern for you, rest easy that at this point, the items are microwave-safe.As for the items themselves, I'm very pleased with them, and so are my boys. Well, the only thing I can complain about is the set of pink items, which are not in any way unisex, but that's the only thing I don't like about these items. They're sturdy, hard plastic that doesn't "give" easily.The cups hold 8 oz and are the perfect size for my boys- I love the wideness that makes them harder to tip over. They are not toddlers; they're young school-age children, yet we find them to be perfect for their needs. I don't like them using my breakable dishes/glasses, but I also don't want them eating & drinking from potentially harmful plastics that leach into food and drink. I thought these were the perfect solution. They're big enough to hold portions big enough for their ages. The boys love the colors (save for the pink) and the fish design, and, for now at least, are excited to use them at every meal.
