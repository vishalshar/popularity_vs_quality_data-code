Smaller than expected. But so far, with mutilple washes and usages, it's still functional. The top tray is swallow. I usually use it for ketchup (for chicken nugget) or small fruits pieces. I can fit a ham-cheese sandwich in the bottom tray by cutting off the crusts, cutting the sandwich in half, then slightly overlapping the halfs. It will not be big enough to hold food for kids 6 and up.... but it works for my preschooler. I haven't had any problem with the seal of the container either.
