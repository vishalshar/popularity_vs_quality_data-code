I hope everyone who posted a comment on here about the characters not coming off, come back at some point and get to read this review...This arrived a few days ago for my toddler for Xmas, but i couldn't take seeing him play with an old plastic container, opening it up with his toys stuffed inside going "Yoooo Gabbaaa!!!" anymore.... so i just thought, Imma give it to him early ; )When i first looked this toy up and read the reviews about the figurines on top not coming off, it kinda killed it for me... but i bought it anyway, and then ordered some Yo Gabba Gabba beanie babies (which haven't come yet) that i figured he could use to really play Yo Gabba with.Well just right now, i noticed they DO come off! There are screws in their backs, connecting them to the boom box handle. Once you remove the screws, just twist 'em right off!! They break off of their base that's planted into the boom box.Then i just took an Xacto knife and trimmed the bases of their feet flat, so they can stand up, and carved off the little "tube" on their backs that the screw went into. DONE!!This toy rocks, my kid hasn't stopped playing with it, gets up and dances every time the "dance" song comes on, and now that the little figurines come off, he's even MORE stoked! well worth the money!
