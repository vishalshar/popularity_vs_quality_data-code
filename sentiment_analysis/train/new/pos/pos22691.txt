I recently bought this for my 8 month old son and he just loves his jeep! After reading many reviews, O was really concerned that he was going to brake the lights on it and hurt himself. But when we got the jeep in, the lights are actually very sturdy. It's such a cool walker for a little boy. It's almost a cute prop for capturing photos of him. It is very easy to put together. It took him just a few days to figure out that he can actually take off in it. He walked backwards first. We also bought him a baby einstein jumper, thinking we would just get a bouncer jumper, or a walker but they both do different things. First child! What can I say. We'd buy anything to see him smile.
