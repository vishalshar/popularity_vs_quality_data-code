This allows kids to sit on a big potty without falling in.  I also like that it's an added layer between my child and a gross public toilet.  It folds up when not in use and clicks into place when in use.  It is very easy to fold and unfold.  It folds in such a way that the parts that touch the toilet don't touch the top of the seat, although I usually wipe it down with a wipe after each use.  It does not take up much space when folded although it is a tight fit for my purse and may not fit in a smaller purse.  It is easily fitted into a diaper bag or suitcase.  My daughter was scared of "big potties" at first and this really helped us when forced to use a public restroom.  The seat is round rather than the oblong shape you get with non-folding potty seats.  I'm sure this is for space saving reasons.  This means it only covers the front half of a toilet.  My daughter weighs 29 pound and the seat has never buckled under her weight.  Sometimes the seat slips a little but she has never fallen in and I find it sturdy enough for a travel seat.  This is great for travel and now that my daughter is potty trained this seat goes everywhere with us.  We kept the plastic bag it came in that snaps shut and use that as a carrying case.
