I will start by admitting that I'm not the strongest mother out there and I am very lazy, I love convenience. This stroller is worth every penny. You can fold it with one hand and you will never be the pain of a restaurant. With its rotating capabilities the baby can sit at the table with you and you won't need to be blocking traffic. It has a lot of really cool features, cup holder, foot extension, head cover. I have friends who've purchased the Bugaboo and various PegPreggos, but after seeing how the Orbit works, they're all over it!
