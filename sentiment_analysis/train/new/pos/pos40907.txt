Decent product. The frame is nice, just a regular frame. The "putty" is really sticky and a bit hard to handle. I did not have much trouble but I can understand the frustrations listed in other reviews. I was able to get 1 hand and 1 foot print on the putty. I let it sit in some tinfoil for about a week and the material is still soft, but the impressions have not changed as some others have mentioned.For those who buy this, some tips.-Wash your hands well.-Any spec of dust WILL STICK TO IT (do not let it fall on the carpet like I did).-When getting the putty out of the foil, use the putty itself to get it off the packaging (kind of like using tape to remove any tape residue left on a surface... if that makes sense).-For a flat surface, i just wrapped tinfoil around the piece of glass from the frame (careful not to break the glass).-The roller worked well for me to flatten the putty.-I didn't need to knead the putty, I just rolled it into a cylinder and flattened it with the roller.-If you mess up, DO NOT PANIC. Just start over. This is suppose to be fun.-The putty takes a long time (days) to "dry/harden". I left it on the tinfoil COVERED (if you don't cover it, dust will get onto it... trust me) for like 1 week and it's still a little soft.I've read in other reviews that there are better products out there. Someone mentioned Target. This is the only time I've used something like this so I don't know. This worked fine for me. Hope this helps.
