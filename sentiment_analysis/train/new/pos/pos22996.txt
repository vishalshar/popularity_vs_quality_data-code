I purchased the Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor for sort of a non conventional use - I used it to listen in on my mom at night while she lived with us.  She had Alzheimer's and would be up and down during the night or nap a lot during the day.  This monitor allowed me to listen in and come to her if she needed me. I was able to place the base unit in her room and carry the receiver with me.  I had no issues with hearing even the slightest sounds she would make.  It gave me great peace of mind.  The system lasted several years and I am now passing it on to a friend who is taking care of one of her parents in much the same way.  These are not just for baby use - they are exceptional tools to have when caring for a loved one.
