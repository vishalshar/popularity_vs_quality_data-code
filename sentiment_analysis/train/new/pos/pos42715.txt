Overall I like this rocking chair. It was really easy to put on the back and arms. The chair itself seems sturdy and solid. The seat and arm padding is a little chintzy. The back padding is comfortable. The seat is a little shallow so if you are really tall or have long upper legs you may be a little uncomfortable. I am 5'7" and the edge of the seat hits about at the middle of the back of my legs. There is about 3-4" from the edge of the seat to the bend of my knee. For me, that cuts off my circulation a little bit. If I use a foot stool or if the seat padding were more plush, it would probably feel better.
