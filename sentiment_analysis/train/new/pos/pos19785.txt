At the beginning I was little skeptical about this product since the initial odor was quite strong. I was afraid that this product will overpower the stinky pails and last only a couple of days or so. Boy, I was definitely wrong. Both wife and I love the product that works as advertised. The tabs smells very pleasant and they're long lasting. We decided to purchase more tabs even for the main trash can and I totally recommend this product to everyone that is trying to get rid of smelly stuff. Also the vendor's customer service and delivery was outstanding!
