The perfect nipples! Inexpensive and they DO NOT LEAK :)  So why so many reviews that say they do? Most likely reason - the nipple ring they are using.I read reviews on these, and after sifting through the good and the bad, I found a few that said these work with the Emfamil nipple rings, so I decided to give them a try. I'm SO happy I did!I will tell you that they are smaller than the Emfamil nipple, so they feel a bit loose in the ring until you tighten it on the bottle.  I was skeptical until I actually started using them.I'm able to use the Gerber nipples with the Emfamil nipple ring with the Madela bottle (as pictured). The Madela bottles are pretty standard size, so my guess is as long as you have standard size bottles this solution will work.
