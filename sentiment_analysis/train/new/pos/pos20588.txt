These bags are a lifesaver. Or at least a nose-saver!I keep a stash of them in my diaper bag and another handful are tucked away in my car. Because, let's face it: dirty diapers STINK, and nobody wants to breathe in that smell a moment longer than necessary during diaper changes. When you're on the go and have to change your little one's diaper some place that doesn't have a garbage can nearby - like, say, in your car - these little bags are SO HELPFUL. They're made to hold in that stink so it doesn't fill the room (or the car, or your diaper bag, or the great outdoors), and thankfully, they succeed!Just tie that smelly diaper up in one of the bags and set it aside until you can get it into a trash can. They won't contain the smell forever, but you're not likely to hang onto a dirty diaper for too long anyway!When our fancy diaper pail stopped working and began smelling truly awful whenever we had a diaper in there more than a few hours, I began buying these bags to keep around the house as well. Dirty diapers get tied up, then tossed into the diaper pail. Voila! We can walk into my son's room without gagging on the stench. They keep the stink contained until we're ready to empty the pail. Phew!
