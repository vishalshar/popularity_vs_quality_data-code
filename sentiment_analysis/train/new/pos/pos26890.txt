I have 2 boys 5 and 3.  We have owned this stroller for 1 year, and I still love it.  It takes a little while to learn how to fold it down quickly, once you've got it down it's quick.  The stroller handles well, and have taken it to Disney world twice.  I was so glad to have a more compact double there, versus the larger side by sides.
