I was debating between this and a backpack style diaper bag - and I'm glad I decided on this. It has plenty of pockets and slots for everything I need. I can fit 2 outfits, a blanket, 3 bottles (on back), formula dispenser, a water bottle, 6 disposable diapers, wipes, small talcum bottle, changing pad, 2 bibs, cream, a toy or two depending on the size, and a few odds and ends that I keep for him. I can probably fit a few more things - but anymore and it will start making it hard to close compartments. This is great for short-to-medium trips - and looks great as well.It is extremely well made - quality product all around.
