Has crank and on/off switch. Fully-cranked, it lasts 60-90 seconds - more than enough to hit the head or wash a dish or start the coffee pot. My two-month old has his worse moments and sometimes this mobile is the only thing that will calm him down or keep him calm. I hope that lasts.My ONLY complaint is you can't play the music separately from the motion, but it's not that bad because the tune is NOT bothersome or irritating (I know, ask me again in another month - but honestly I do hear this thing a lot). I do love that there is also a switch; I always crank the dial fully and turn the switch off when I'm done using it so it's primed and ready for another go the instant I need it. The dolls are cute.The arm isn't like the MOST adaptable thing; you have to have a flat crib wall within a fairly confined range of heights to be able to affix it. The upper side rail on our crib is not flush with the crib wall so our mobile leans over a little, but it is secure enough for now. The first time he stands up and yanks on it he'll probably break it but that'll be my error as a parent if it does happen.
