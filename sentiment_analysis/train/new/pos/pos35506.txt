I see that alot of other customers said theirs have started to flake but I have not had this issue.  My daughter received the Minnie set for her birthday and after 3 months of daily use it shows minimal wear and has held up great; the only real "wear" is my own fault because I sometimes use a knife on the plate itself to cut my daughter's food.  More often then not this goes in the dishwasher (TOP RACK ONLY) along with the silverware (again TOP RACK ONLY in one of those baby bottle parts basket).  I purchased the Mickey set so that we had another to use and because I liked the size for my 15 month old.  Yes the ears are a little small but they are perfect for condiments and dipping.
