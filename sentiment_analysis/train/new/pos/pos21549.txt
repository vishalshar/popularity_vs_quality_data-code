My daughter has a ton of the peek-a-blocks, and she just LOVES them! When I read the review saying they are dangerous, I had to add my two cents :) First of all, I don't know what the person means by saying the blocks have sharp edges, I have never noticed anything sharp on the blocks, EVER. And as for their child getting hurt by falling on the blocks, that could happen with anything,doesnt mean it's the blocks fault. My daughter fell the other day and smacked her mouth on the floor, causing her teeth to go through her lip. There were no toys around, so should be call floors dangerous too? Just seems a ridiculous claim really. Children fall and get hurt all the time, its part of childhood. After 5 kids, I've learned that lesson well! :) All in all I have to say that I think the Peek-a-blocks are the greatest! I don't see them as a danger in any kind of way! In fact I am buying her even more of them for christmas this year :) Hope this helps!
