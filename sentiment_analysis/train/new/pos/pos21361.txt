This gate was purchased to keep Max, my Dobie, in the kitchen and his own room which adjoins the kitchen. All parts were in excellent condition and the gate was quite reasonably easy to install. The doorway is 36" wide so I had to use one of the two extensions that was provided. There is a gap of approximately 2 1/4" on each side which is within the limit of 3" as indicated in the installation guide. This is by far the most attractive gate I have ever owned. This gate replaced a Richell which was twice as expensive, much less attractive, harder to install and far less sturdy. In fact, I had to use duct tape to hold the Richell together in places where it came apart.The reason I deducted one star and declared it "almost  perfect" is because there is no option to keep the gate open. Nearly every day I give Max the run of the house for a while. He likes to run back and forth to get a bone or a play toy from his room. This gate does not let him do that unless I open the gate for him each time. It would not take much of an engineering change in the gate closer to have a lever or slide or some type of control to temporarily disable the closer function when desired. Other then that, this gate is top notch and well worth the price.
