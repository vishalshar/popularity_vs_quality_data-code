our son has both Down syndrome & sensory issues.  he has hated every stuffed animal we showed him, until now!!  this is not a stuffed animal/toy, however, he could not wait for me to get it out of the box - once I did, he grabbed it & gave it a big hug and kiss.  another note is I'm one of those parents who was hesitant to put my kid on a "leash" - not anymore.  he takes off on my mom in a parking lot, and like most kids doesn't listen too well & he has a communication disorder.  this was a must & we went for a walk the other day, he didn't fight this at all.  he actually liked to hold on to the paws when he was walking - a plus because it kept his hands busy.  I'm also thinking the pouch (not really a backpack) would be an ideal place to possibly put a little weight, which has been recommended by his OT for sensory purposes.  another note - the "tail" does hook onto the loop on the side strap, so there is 2 choices, either on the side or on the bottom.  I was also concerned he might fall if he tugged on it to get away - he didn't.  I've given it 4 stars because I have not used it with my hands full or in a parking lot or with my mom but OVERALL, highly recommend it.
