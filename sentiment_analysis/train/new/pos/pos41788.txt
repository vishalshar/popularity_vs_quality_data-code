I  originally a bit leery to use this pillow because it was much less expensive then some of the other pillows that said they would correct the flat head, however this pillow is great. My daughter prefers to have her head facing to the right so she developed a pretty flat spot. I was very worried. We have been using this pillow now for less than a month and it has completely resolved. I use it when she sleeps and when she is in her cradle, swing, I don't feel that it is dangerous for her to use all. It works great and I would definitely recommend it.
