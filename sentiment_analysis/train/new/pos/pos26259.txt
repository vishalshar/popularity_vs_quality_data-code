I have installed these in my rental property hallways.  They light the entrance and hall with sufficient light to pass through safely.  The hall is not heated and has gotten VERY cold this winter.  Not a problem for these bulbs.  I installed them with a photo-eye adapter so they go off when sunlight illuminates the hall, saving even more energy.  The bulbs are physically smaller than normal sized bulbs so even with the photo eye adapter they fit in the light fixture, unlike regular sized bulbs.  They arrived quickly and in working order.  I highly recommend the bulbs and the supplier.
