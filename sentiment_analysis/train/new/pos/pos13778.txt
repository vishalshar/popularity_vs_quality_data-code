We knew from other ratings that if we purchased this dresser it would come with broken and missing pieces.  We were missing a couple of small parts, we had to request another drawer because of dings and we also had to request another knob.  We contact Lajobi via email regarding all of these issues and we had the replacement parts we needed within the week.  My husband put it together by himself and he had to get out the drill and move holes to make all of the parts fit together.  However, now that all of these issues have been fixed and were fairly painless to fix, we have a nice dresser.  It hasn't been used yet but I think it makes a great addition and matches the Graco Lauren crib very well.
