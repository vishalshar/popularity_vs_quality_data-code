I was working on finding a good sippy cup for my son who had turned one for some time.  Sippy after sippy he didn't mind it for water and juice but REFUSED to drink milk from it.  He'd rather do a crying fit than drink milk from sippy cups.I finally found one of these spouts on a cup and decided to give yet another one a try.  HE LOVED IT.I went out and bought several of these Active Cups with the spout.He finally drank milk from a sippy cup at 19 months old.At 24 months and 3 weeks, in other words about six months, the spouts were no longer clear and my son was gnawing on the spout hole making it bigger and having milk spill everywhere.I ordered the six pack spouts March 31st, 2013.  April 1st I got an email that it was shipped.  Whenever I'd go to the link in the email to monitor the tracking it would give me an error, so I would go directly to amazon and look through my orders.Estimated arrival was April 9th, however I received it April 12, 2013.I'm very happy with these spouts though I do hope my son can go to another sippy cup soon because to me its still a bottle (though its called an active cup).
