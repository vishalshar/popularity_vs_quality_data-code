I didn't have very high expectations for this crib especially given the low price. We bought this for our third child. Our previous crib was worn out after two kids and we didn't want to pay a lot for a crib that's only going to be used once. After browsing online for inexpensive, simple, nice looking cribs this one seemed to fit the bill. I was able to put it together by myself in about 35 minutes. Once it was up I was VERY impressed with how sturdy it was. When I first took it out of the box and felt the somewhat lightweight/cheapish quality of the individual pieces I was worried. Once it was together it feels amazingly sturdy and even heavy. I can't emphasize this point enough because it truly impressed me. I can't get this thing to wiggle, warp, bend, or creak in the least. The appearance is very nice. I was worried that I'd notice the exposed screw heads, but in fact it's a non-factor for me. I'm not sure what else to say about this simple, classic crib. I have confidence that it'll hold my child safely and look good while doing so. I'd highly recommend this versus paying 2-5 times as much for a fancy one. Save your money for the child's college. Buy this!
