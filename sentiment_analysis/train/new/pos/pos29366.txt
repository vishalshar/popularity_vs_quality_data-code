I love this humidifier because it lasts long.  My brother is already through his 3rd humidifier in 4 years while I've only had this unit for 4 years it has more years ahead.  Also, I find the volume at the low setting very soothing and helps me fall asleep.  I've read the posts that mention the filters being hard to find.  However, they are very easy to find.  The evenflo filter is the SAME EXACT filter as the Holmes HWF62 filter which is available in many places since Holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter.  I just purchased a "colorcheck" by Holmes filter from Walmart and I still have an original evenflo branded filter from last year.  I put them up to each other and they are the SAME EXACT dimensions.  Actually, I prefer the colorcheck over the original evenflo filter because I think it lasts longer before needing replacement.  If you look at the bottom of the evenflo humidifier box, it will say that this humidifier was manufactored by Holmes for evenflo.  Therefore, it would only make sense that a Holmes filter would be compatible with this unit.
