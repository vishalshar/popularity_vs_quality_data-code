After being disappointed by Graco's quality of car seats, I decided to try Britax! I recently bought a Britax Frontier 85 and was SO excited about the seat. My son is 10 months old and is outgrowing his Graco infant seat. I didn't realize however that the seat is only good for children at least 2 years old. So with MUCH regret I had to return the Frontier! I ordered the Britax Marathon 70 and absolutely love it (as much as I did the Frontier 85).It is so nicely cushioned and yet spacious enough. I'm 5'1 and 105 lbs and I can sit in the seat (not harnessed of course) with the headrest at its highest. My son's back is not curved in anyway and his head is not pushed forward at all. He looks so comfortable, I want to be him in this seat! I love that I will be able to rear-face my son for longer and then forward-face him when he's ready. The crotch strap is GREAT! Moving it is a breeze -- just slide it over (nothing to disassemble). It has 2 position, but the furthest one is pretty far (8 inches from the back of the seat). The Graco Nautilus' furthest crotch strap measured at 6.5 inches from the back... one of the main reasons I returned it cause my son would have no room to grow into and would inevitably be sitting on the crotch strap before he's even 2 years old. The harness straps are so easy and FAST to adjust!!! You just move the headrest up and down! No need to unfasten the harness and re-thread it through the loops. The recline is a REAL recline (3 positions). Graco Nautilus' recline was like half an inch difference. Oh, and the steel frame is excellent (versus a heavy-duty plastic). I think all car seats should be made of a steel frame. Which makes this car seat, though very expensive, worth the money in every way!!! And I'm pretty frugal. From now on, every car seat I buy will be a Britax!
