I currently have 3 of these - my hubby and my 3 year old commandeered a pillow each, and so I ended up buying yet another one. These pillows are soft cotton filled pillows. It's a great size. I have tried larger pregnancy pillows that are too cumbersome. This is the perfect size and doesn't get in the way of trying to roll over with a ginormous pregnant belly. The softness is sometimes a drawback, as I could use a little more support as I get further along, but it's hard to blame the pillow at this stage, as nothing is comfortable anymore. It's a great pregnancy pillow with a removable cover. Please note- this pillow would be way too soft for nursing, so it is limited to being used as a pillow only; however I still continued to use it week after I had baby.
