We have tried SO many sippy cups in the last few years, and these by TOMY are my favorite.  After purchasing so many, here is what is important to me:1.  Very few pieces.  The more pieces for each cup, the more they get lost. Or my kids take them apart. Or a piece doesn't come home from daycare. Or their grandparents can't figure out how to assemble them. So many issues.  These cups have 2 parts...a cup and a lid!2. Unlikely to mold.  So many cups out there have small crevices, tiny straws, etc.  These have just  two small membranes (made into the cup).  The only ones we've had to mold are our fault--they get left in the car and are found under the seat a month later.3. No leaking!  This is the hardest to find for us. So many cups leak, especially after they are dropped or thrown a few times. We've had great success with this not leaking, even after two years of heavy use.  Sometimes they will begin to leak at the membrane when they get old, but it's much later than many other cups we've had.4. Cute design.  My kiddos love the dinosaurs, even though they are too young and sensitive for the movie.I bought these to supplement our old cups now that my littlest needs them too. These are great and I'll be using them until my boys don't need a sippy any more!  Also, these are cheaper on Amazon than at your local store, a big bonus!
