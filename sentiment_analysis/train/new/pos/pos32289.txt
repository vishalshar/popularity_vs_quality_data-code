I have wraps and ring slings and this is my go to soft structured carrier.  The hood attachment is a good design and I use it often because my daughter falls asleep in it.  My husband and I switch using it all the time and it is a sinch to adjust.  I also love the zipper pocket to hold keys, phone, mail, or doggy bag (we do lots of walking the dog with this) and our daughter will sometimes bring it too us so that we will wear her (she is 14 months).  We like it for both front and back carry, however she can't really see over the shoulders when on the back, but that is the nature of this type of carrier.  A wrap will get your baby higher so they can see.  I will say that if you want to wear your baby on the front, and use a backpack at the same time, the fat padded straps can be in the way a little, but it is certainly doable.
