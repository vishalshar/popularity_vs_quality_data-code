This is a great infant mirror for the car. The reflection is clear and it has a pivoting arm so you can angle the mirror easily. It is simple to install on the headrest and stays securely. I love it. I wish it had a light, which might help with the baby screaming at night in the carseat, but other than that, it is exactly what I wanted.The only downside is the persistent company that sold it to me. They sent me email after email, and then finally called me on the phone to get me to leave a review. It was a little much. But it worked, I guess.
