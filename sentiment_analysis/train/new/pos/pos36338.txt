Really great product. I bought both, the Organic Cotton interlock cradle sheet, as well as the 100% cotton value jersey knit cradle sheet. And what a difference is in quality. The value sheet is very thin, and given that the crib mattress is usually made of plastic/vinyl material, you need something that removes the plastic-y feel. This organic cotton interlock sheet is the one to do the job. It is quite thick (so you do not get the feel of plastic mattress underneath) and the material is very soft and had a luxurious feel. This sheet uses organic cotton, while I know organic food is good, not sure if organic material is a necessity, but most times Amazon sells this for just $1 above the price of the value sheet, so it makes sense to buy this rather than the value sheets, and the quality of the sheets are much much much better.
