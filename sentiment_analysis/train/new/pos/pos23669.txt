If it weren't for the functionality of (1) the brake mechanism and (2) the pneumatic lift, I'd give this chair 5 stars. It has all of the features I was looking for: it has wheels for ease of movement, it's very easy to clean, my baby can't tip it over and it's not an eyesore. It really is a great chair. However, there are two issues with the chair of which prospective buyers should be aware:1. The "brake" doesn't actually prevent the chair from being rolled across a smooth surface, even by my 11-month old (who likes to roll it across the hardwood floor). Instead, engaging the "brake" simply makes the chair slightly more difficult for her to move. I see from numerous other reviews that Boon has indicated this is an intentional design to prevent the chair from being tipped over by a child. That said, the base is so wide I don't see how it would be possible for any child to tip over the chair. In any event, although I'd prefer that my child couldn't roll the chair across the floor, it doesn't seem like such a big deal in return for the chair's other great features.2. The pneumatic lift is very difficult to use, even for my husband. So, we just leave the chair at the same height all the time. This isn't a problem for us. But if you're buying the chair for its pneumatic lift function, you should be aware of this.I hope this review was helpful!
