Bought this dresser because of the reviews and was not disappointed. It is a very good value for the price.  The doors slide well and have stops so that there is no danger of little children pulling the drawers out onto themselves.  Young children can easily manage these drawers.  This is especially good for 2 and 3 year olds who want to do everything themselves, but the height of the dresser is such that it will work for many years.  The assembly took only about 2 hours and was not difficult.  The finished product is a high gloss wood that is very sturdy, making it easy to wipe off smudges.  I think it would be fun to add different knobs to either match the decor or color in the room.
