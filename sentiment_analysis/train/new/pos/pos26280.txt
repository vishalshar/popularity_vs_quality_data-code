I love this bag! It just got delivered today. I haven't used it yet, but I've used a lot of diaper bags over the years.  I've seen a lot of reviews on here and video reviews stating this bag is huge.  Although, it is a sizable bag, I wouldn't say its as big as people are saying.  I have 2 kids ages 3 and 1 with another on the way and I think this bag will be perfect for all of the stuff i have to carry.  I'm going to use it as a hospital bag and then my main daily diaper bag.  I'm used to using larger bags, up until I had kids I would use a messenger bag as a purse, so maybe i'm just used to the size. I do love all of the pockets and compartments. I hate to keep my diapering stuff in the same compartment as snacks and drinks, so this bag is perfect for that.  The mommy compartment will also come in handy so I wont have to carry around a separate purse. I'm so glad I did not take other reviewers advice and go for the smaller BFF bag. Generally newborns dont need a huge bag, but as they get older there's lots of stuff to carry.  Clothes, diapers, wipes, snacks, bottles, water, formula, breastmilk...  so it would be a good investment. I've also included some size comparison pictures with th traditional tote style diaper bag and our current bag which is traditional sized backpack.
