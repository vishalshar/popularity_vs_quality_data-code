Our baby has been enjoying this toy on a regular basis for several months (consequently, meaning it's been washed a lot), yet it shows no signs of wear. The ringing it makes when shaken is pleasant and can be easily tolerated by parents for hours, unlike some similar toys. Love that it's a natural product, but disappointed that it's made in China and not the US or Canada. We would own all the Zooley teething rings if they were produced here. Overall, this toy is definitely worth the cost.
