I purchased this item for my daughter and it has been everything I wanted and more. I love it because it is so much safer to have the baby walk around in one area than walk around the whole house. I can lock the wheels and she can still walk in place since the seat turns around in a complete circle. It has wonderful toys, lights and music on the other side of the tree in the shape of fruits and each is a different color. It teaches colors, fruits and even short sentences. The other side of the tree has 3 flip open leafs and each reveals a plastic photo frame where you can put pictures. A picture for Daddy, Mommy, and Baby. When the baby tugs on the leaf each sais "Mommy", "Daddy", "Baby". The bee buzzes in and out of the hive, and the other toys rattle and spin, It also has two teether toys that are not really visible in this picture. Best of all you can remove many of the toys really easy and take them along with you. This Walker looks great and is a real show stopper. Everyone in our family loves it because it is so cute and safe too. It is not that hard to travel with. It fits in my truck and I have a camry, I just have to lower the settings for the height. My daughter loves it. I really recommend it especially if you are a new parent like my husband and I. It makes me feel safe knowing my daughter is in this walker and nearby where I can see her.
