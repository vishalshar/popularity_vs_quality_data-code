I found my charger brought 2 near dead (protection circuit cut off point) 18650 cells to full charge in about 2.6 hours.  They did warm up during charging and once the indicator turned green it was quite a task to get the batteries out of the charger.  Next time I am going to put a kapton strip behind the top and bottom of both batteries to give me something to pull on to remove them.  With the thermal expansion of charging it is very difficult to remove the finished cells right after they are done.The charger features a folding prong design which is nice for travel since it can hold two of your batteries and pack in your luggage, then unfold upon arrival.I do wish they could have made a multiple size (eg 14250, 18650) charger with a better grabber, however my chargers with those floating grabbers often don't have enough spring force to ensure good contact through the charging process, so its a trade off.  The Tenergy 18650 2600 mah 4 pcs Tenergy Li-Ion 18650 3.7V 2600 mAh Rechargeable Batteries with Internal PCB for flashlights and others cells I charged came out a 4.23V per cell which shows they are being fully charged by the unit.
