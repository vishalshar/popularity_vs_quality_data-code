This set is nice and did come with everything that was listed. The price was also great. I really only used the bumper pads, quilt, bed skirt, and diaper bag becuase I found different valances that I liked better. The toy holder had baby blue on it which I thought should have been navy to match the rest of the set. Still am happy with it and looks great in my sons americana/primitive western room
