All three of my babies have these taggies snuggies. They are inseparable--absolutely the best snuggie. The soft and silky sides plus the tags are comforting to babies, and the blankets are breathable enough that I don't worry about letting them sleep with them even from a young age. I just wish ALL of them had rattle heads. My oldest son's frog is a rattle head, and it is hard to find ones that rattle! I ordered this one without realizing that this brand doesn't have all rattle heads.
