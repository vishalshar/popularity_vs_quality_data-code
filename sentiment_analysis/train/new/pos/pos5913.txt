I really like this diaper bag. It is a little smaller than I expected but none the less totally worth the price I paid. I didnt notice in the picture that the straps were so thin and look cheap but thats my fault. I should have known I wasnt going to get leather with the price I paid. I still love this bag(s) though it has all the accessorie bags and very cute design!
