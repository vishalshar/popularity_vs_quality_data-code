I purchased the alphabet set and realized I wanted to cover more space, so I got the numbers and pictures set.  The quality is just fine.  The numbers are pretty self-explanatory, though the pictures are a bit eclectic.  I can imagine my son using them as a puzzle in a year or so, as each picture has a few pieces in different colors.  The picture pieces are: a house, a truck, a turtle, a teddy bear, flower, whale, frog, fish, seal, and a telephone.  This set contains 20 squares whereas the alphabet set obviously has 26.  Really good price for this set!
