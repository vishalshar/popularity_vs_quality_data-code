These were fabulous when my milk initially came in. I kept them in the freezer and they helped TREMENDOUSLY with the discomfort from engorgement. They didn't stay cold for super long, but they definitely provided the relief I needed. I also tried them warm when I had a clogged duct. These are wonderful and reusable.
