These are by far my favorite cups. They WILL NOT leak! My kids throw them around all day and not drop comes out. It took my oldest a little while to figure it out because you do have to suck pretty hard to get the water flowing but both of my kids use these every day with no problem. They are easy to wash. The valve is easy to pop on and off to clean it. I tried plenty of other name brand and off brand cups. My daughter bit holes in the soft spout cups and even the hard spout cups would leak if left on their side. I have 6 of these cups for my two kids and will never buy another brand!
