I am very pleased with this pack 'n play. We used it as a crib for the first month and are now using it as a secondary sleep place. While it can be challenging to set up and take down, the instructions are very clear and after a few attempts, it will come naturally. This PnP is much sturdier than another playard (BabyTrend) we borrowed for a weekend trip. The only complaint I have is that the changing table and mobile don't fit in the storage bag. While I could care less about bringing the mobile on vacation, it would be nice if the changing table would fit (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). Also, it is worth noting that the changing table pieces are difficult to take apart. Overall good, sturdy PnP--I would highly recommend.Update April 2011: I used this for baby #2 and it is still working well. We've taken it all around the world so it has had its fair share of baggage handler tossing--it is still sturdy. Love it.Update December 2012: I am still using this product for baby #3. It has held up well, but the bassinet feature is starting to sag a little. But, after 3 being used three times, I would say this thing is quite durable.
