I just recieved my ordered safari bedding items in the mail. I love the bedding! The pattern is wonderful for any gender and unlike much of what I saw available in many stores. I love it! It will be perfect for my little girl on the way. I am more pleased with everything than I thought I would be. Several people stated that it was difficult to find pieces. That I admit, but there is still quite a bit available online. Of what was available, I just ordered the pieces I really wanted anyhow. And for what wasn't available, I will have my crafty mom make by hand in coordinating patterns such as gingham and coordinating colors. For example, I'll have her do extra bedsheets, a decorator pillow, diaper stacker, larger pillowcase and flat sheet (to use for the toddler years). So it will all work out. As far as shipping, the items came very quickly. At first my order confirmation gave me a much later receiving date. I think it was like 6-8 weeks. But everything was here in about a week. I was very pleased. And finally, the quality. I won't be able to truly test the quality for about six weeks. but I've inspected everthing and it looks to be well made. Like somebody else said, even the comforter squares are individually sewn. I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy this purchase for a long time to come. 1st time Mommy
