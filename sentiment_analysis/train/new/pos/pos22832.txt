I really love the cozy, minky fabric of this elephant blanket. The brown is a manly color for my little guy, and doesn't show stains at all. However, the one thing you should be aware of is that the elephant on this is really pretty big, about 10" x 8". Because the stitching on the elephant is less soft than the rest of the blanket, I find myself not wanting to set his head or bare skin against the elephant portion of it, so I wish the elephant was quite a bit smaller. Other than that, this is a fantastic blanket and I would certainly purchase it again for myself or for a friend.
