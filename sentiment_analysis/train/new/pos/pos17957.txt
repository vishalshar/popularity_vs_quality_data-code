My brother and I bought this diaper bag for a friend of ours. She first saw it in Babies R' Us, but the only available color was orange. She didn't like that color, but figured that it was the best option for her and her baby. When we saw this green color online, we decided to surprise her with it for her baby shower. It came right on time, and our friend could not have been more pleased. Its functionality is perfect for her needs. Now when she runs into other new mothers, they are always jealous of her awesome bag! Her husband doesn't even mind carrying it because it's so cool. We haven't seen her without it since her daughter was born.
