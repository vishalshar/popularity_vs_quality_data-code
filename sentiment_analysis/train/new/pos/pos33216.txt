I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.
