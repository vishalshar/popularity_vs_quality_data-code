I recently bought this bath kneeler hoping to make bath time a little more comfortable for mom & dad and it did the trick! It's comforatble on the knees, you don't feel the floor or anything hard. I sometimes use it to sit on as well. The pattern is really cute and fun and it's easy to clean/wipe off. I don't find it to be slippery at all. I do wish it was a little longer though but I don't think that is a deal breaker. I would recommend buying if you are looking for a comfortable bath kneeler to save your knees.
