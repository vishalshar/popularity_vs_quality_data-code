The Disney princess baby walker is fantastic!The main reason why I found this walk on Amazon was because I was looking for something that was collapsible so that I could slide it under a bed when it's not in use and this is perfect.The Walker is pretty easy to put together, there is a trick to attaching the white trays onto the top of the walker which is you have to make sure that the plastic piece that sticks into the pink plastic doesn't get caught… You'll understand what this means when you are putting together.Walker comes with four toys that attach the top of it, the castle toy that lights up red and sings the song does require two AA batteries. I love that you can open up the toy train to have the food tray without fully removing it, you just pull the little tabs on the bottom to release the trays. The Walker itself is a little bit tricky to raise and lower, however I feel they probably made the button so hard to push in to make sure that it didn't accidentally drop down while your child is using it.Along with collapsing you can raise and lower the walker to different heights depending on how tall your child is. At the lowest level my daughters tippy toes barely touch the floor… She is a week under five months old.There are a few reasons why give us four stars rather than five stars in this may be a dealbreaker for customers. The first one is that the wheels on the walker do not lock. There is no way to lock the wheels into place if you want to keep your child in one area. The second is that in order to wash the fabric portion, which is what your child sits in, you actually have to unscrew it from the plastic pieces. Only half of them are easy snaps the other actual Phillips head screws.
