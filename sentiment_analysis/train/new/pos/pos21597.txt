Great and versatile baby blanket. I would not limit its use to "receiving" only: it's big enough to serve as a regular blanket for a toddler's bed. The two sides made of different material are very handy: cotton provides more traction and better breathability, while plush feels great to touch. I think this will come very handy with different seasons. The colors are also quite delightful.
