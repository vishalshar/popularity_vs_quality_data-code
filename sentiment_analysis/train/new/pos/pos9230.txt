I have the manual Philip Avent ISIS. Two years ago, the valves were flat. I always had trouble with those valves as they would get loose after repeated use and sterilization. I did not mind having to replace them, but I could not find replacements anywhere. I managed to successfully complete a years worth of pumping with 3 valves. Now I am once again pumping. I started a massive search looking for valves. The new valves continued popping up on my searches and never the old ones. I bought them being very skeptical of their effectiveness. After the first use, I can say with pleasure that these are much better than the old valves. They don't fall out while pumping and can easily be seen in the sterilizer (so they don't disappear). Since the old valves are no longer available, you can rest assured that these will get the job done.
