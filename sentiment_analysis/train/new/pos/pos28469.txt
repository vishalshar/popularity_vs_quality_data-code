My daughter had been crusing for months and, though she had the strength needed to let go and walk on her own, she was scared to do so. Every time I would hold her up she would sit back down. She would walk holding on to our hands, holding on to furniture... but as soon as she was released, she would sit.The day I received this item, I put it on her and she took to it like fish to water. I guess she knew she had "back up" in case she fell, but she didn't! It forced her to NOT use her hands and was all she needed to gain a little confidence. The following day she was already walking on her own! I LOVE this...
