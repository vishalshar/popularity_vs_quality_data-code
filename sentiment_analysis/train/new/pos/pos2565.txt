LOL at the reviews that complain you can only use them once. they are $1 and are called DISPOSABLE nipple covers. NOT reusable. worth the price to wear under lingerie, a swim top, or a backless top for the daring. They stay on pretty well all day, but once you take them off you will not be able to reuse unless you get some double sided tape or pastie glue.
