I LOVE LOVE LOVE wubbanubs. And so do my twin boys. We had 6-8 in rotation when we were in pacifier stage. I love the soft cuddly, easy to grip stuffed animal the most. We had a bunch of different kinds and the alligator is a good one, doesn't pill when washed repeatedly. And I know some are curious how to sanitize. We had thrush early on and I hated the idea of tossing our wubbanubs, so I boiled them in a pot on the stove for twenty minutes and then washed them in the washing machine. After they wash I hung dry and then washed and rinsed the pacifier part only. Worked great, fully sanitized and after treatment we had no more thrush issues. So they can be sanitized and washed, just so you know! And as for the price... Worth every penny!
