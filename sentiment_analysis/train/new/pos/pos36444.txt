Worked great for my 4.5 son with ADHD and Op-positional Defiance Disorder in Disneyland. He gets angry easily, is impulsive, and will walk away to sulk, and he has even purposely hid from us (his way of putting himself in a timeout to calm down). He is distracted often and so easy to lose, and I was very nervous about him getting lost. He liked the pictures on the tattoos. These tattoos must have been comfortable because I only used 2 in 7 days and 6 nights on my son. He bathed every night. He could have torn it off, but didn't. My nine year old daughter also liked wearing hers. It gave her a sense of confidence that should she get lost, she had her parents phone numbers. My kids rejected wearing the Velcro safety bracelets I also bought. My daughter's bracelet was  very pretty with flowers. I saw this lady whose daughters had typed typed ID tattoos and they were not a gel like sticker like ours and were very cracked. I think you would need rubbing alcohol to get theirs off. She said that she ordered them directly from Safety Tat website. I was unaware there were different types of tattoos. If you think your child will tear it off that might be a better option.
