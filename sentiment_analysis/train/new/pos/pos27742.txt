I was scared to order this product at first since the reviews were not that great, but i decided to order and everything arrived ok. The mobile looks just like the picture and it matches my migi crib set. The only draw back woild have to be that the music only last 2 min. Which is basically nothing. I know ebay sells the part (forgot what is called) that plays different tunes and last 30 min
