My daughter chose this diaper bag. I bought it for her as a gift and she absolutely loves it. She coordinated it with her daughter's car seat and other baby accessories. I haven't seen it because we live on opposite sides of country but I know she is really happy with her choice. When I saw it online I was impressed by how sharp it looks, more like a handbag than a diaper bag. It is very functional and practical as well. Great buy!!! Saw some for 3x as much and have no idea why they are so much more expensive. This one looks elegant and meets my daughter's needs really well. She is a very precise person so I know it must be a great choice and value.
