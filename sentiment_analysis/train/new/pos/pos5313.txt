I purchased for diaper bag use.  The color is just the right tone (intensity) for a trendy look.  The crossover strap is removable but a helpful option for multitasking enroute. Well constructed inside and out.I'd buy again as but a FEW MINOR SUGGESTIONS for manufacturer:  Would love it more if it had additional pocket on the back or sides for 'grab n' go' ease.  The only thing I would change on the structure is to make the interior bottom more squared for packing and for sitting it down.
