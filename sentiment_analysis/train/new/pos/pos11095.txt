This has been one of the best investments for our one year old son.  We bought it for him when he was about 2 months old and the minute we put it on his crib, he loved looking at the mirror on the underside of the mobile and the three animals.  As he got older, he loved to stand in his crib and touch the animals as they went around and around.  Now being almost one, we have removed the mobile portion and have used the base with the giraffe on his crib.  It has become almost as comforting to him as the blankets he sleeps with.  I've watched him numerous times wake up in the middle of the night and hit the giraffe so the music comes on and then go back to sleep, which I assume comforts him.  The tunes from the giraffe are very soothing and comforting.  The mobile is very well made and sturdy.  Great buy!
