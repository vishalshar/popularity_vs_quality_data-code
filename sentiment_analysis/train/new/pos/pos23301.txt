I used this travel bag for a full-sized child safety seat from Graco. Not only did it easily accommodate the seat, there was room to spare. (I also have an Eddie Bauer seat that it will probably be used for eventually, too.)Like I've seen in other people's reviews around the web, I tossed in some extra diapers and wipes and other things that I didn't mind getting thrown around in luggage.The cover held up beautifully, even under United's rough handling. This is what I was looking for - something durable with a heavier gauge than the red seat covers you see that look like they are made from a thin nylon.The cover was excellent and I can see it lasting through other trips as well. If you run across one, I recommend that you grab it up immediately.
