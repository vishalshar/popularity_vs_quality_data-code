My son loves this walker. It took him a day or so to get the idea and start moving his feet, but now he is zipping around our house.I like that the toys can swing out, which leaves you with a fairly good sized tray for snacks. The tray is also deep enough that my son can move his cereal around without knocking it out of the tray. The toys are ok. They don't seem to be super high quality, but they provide a little bit of extra stimulation. Most of the appeal, though, seems to be in the freedom that it provides for my son.The safety grips on the bottom of the walker seem to work well. For example, the walker won't go over our flooring thresholds because they are too high. However, I would note that we only have hard surface flooring in our home, and we don't have any stairs.*Update 12/14/10* My son is 11 months now, and he still enjoys his walker. However, there is no seatbelt in the walker, and he has figured out that if he grabs onto things, then he can pull himself up to stand in (or on) the walker. This has become a big safety issue, so I wanted to note the lack of a seatbelt for other parents with climbers (or future climbers).
