All in all this is a very good well made product. It was easy to put together, I put mine together with the help of my four, three and two year old. The only weird thing about this stool is the top "step" it is meant to come off and on, which it does, easily. I ended up hiding mine because unless it is on the notches perfectly it is a hazard, plus it makes for a pretty high step. I have this Once upon a Pond design bedding etc. and it matches the collection perfectly. The designs are all on the step already you do not have to apply as stickers.
