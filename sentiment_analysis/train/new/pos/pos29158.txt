Didn't try it yet, but I will up date when I do. Came way faster in the mail then I was told it would! Great surprise!!!! Inserts are a weird size, haven't figured out how to exactly use them yet. They are super long. Some how have to be folded. You get x2 per diaper. They seem thin, but maybe folded and used together they will work. I wasn't sure what kind of diaper I was going to get, any one curious it's a fleece inside, if your looking for a water proof kind that you can reuse till its soiled this isn't it. If you don't mind use once and change this is okay! Seems like a good quality, snaps are firm, over all with the fast shipping, i will give it a try! All the positive reviews made me purchase 4 to try. If I like, for the price I will def order more once I try!!!! Hope my pics give you a better idea before you choose to purchase. I say if your not picky, for the price, do it!Update: finally decided to try them or today. Only washed them once. I was bummed when I realized it had a flece liner, I perfer the water proof shell. Expecting to change it every time causing more laundry, I was wrong! I and this cover on my daughter all morning! And surprise with a thin liner and one of my good thicker ones, when I changed her the cover was not wet just the liners. So I changed the liners again a thin one and a thicker one (I didn't use the pockets just my liners in between her bottom and the cover) and second change this morning again get cover wasn't really wet that I had to change it! So in my book this is a plus! Can be reused if you stay on top of changing and use good inserts. Like I said I always use a very thin one and then a thick one. Have from the start and no leaks in my diaper I've ever used. These can get bulky doing that, but I was able to snap her clothing no problem. I'll def order more.
