I just love this bag, I was looking for a diaper bag that didn't look like a diaper bag, and this is it. the size is perfect, not too big, but not too small either. I can accommodate all the items require for a day out with my 14 months old baby.  It comes with a separate pocket in the front to put wallet and whatever mom needs. Inside has a sippy cup holder which is insulated,  and another pocket for little things. I can pack neatly 6 to 8 diapers, a change of clothes, socks, wipes, a small blanket, sippy cup, and a  ziplock bag with snacks among other things. The straps are long enough to wear cross body, and it doesn't feel heavy at all.
