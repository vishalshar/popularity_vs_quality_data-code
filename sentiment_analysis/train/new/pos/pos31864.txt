I'm serious, it was as if an overwhelming unhappiness of being in the car was swelling up inside my 8 month old.  As soon as I switched her into THIS car seat though, she was SO happy, and has been so ever since.  She used to strugle and give me SUCH a difficult time when I'd put her into her old car seat.  Now, she just sits there smiling while I strap her in.  THe arm/chest guard is a great addition to this seat, as Karen likes holding on to it while in the seat.  I HIGHLY recommend this car seat to anyone upgrading from the infant laying position seat.  It makes her feel like a big girl like her older sister.
