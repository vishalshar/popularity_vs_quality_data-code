We used cloth diapers on our toddler daughter but always pad folded the inserts so this was our first experience with a Snappi.  I looked at many photos and videos online how to use them before ordering.  I highly recommend going to Snappi website an watching theirs.  You learn that the little skinny tabs are actually a safety feature to over the prongs, not pull tabs.  (The bigger tabs just past the skinny loops are the pull tabs.). We've been using these on our newborn daughter for a month now since her birth on newborn size Green Mountain Diapers prefolds.The neon colors make them easy to spot.  I keep one in the diaper bag and alternate the other two.  Easy to use, sharp points but once you know about the pull tabs and safety covers built in it makes them much easier to use. Our daughter was just under 6 lbs when we started to use them and the Snappi is as wide as her little body!  Now she is about 8lbs and it fits about the same but still works great.It is fairly fast to put on and I think if we had tried to use safety pins both my husband and myself would have a fit trying to pin them!  Hubby was against prefolds and pins with the new baby but he has an easy time and doesn't mind using the Snappi.Recommended use is 6 months but I am hoping by rotating through the 3pack we can get a lot longer use out of them.  If you plan to use traditional cotton prefolds these are a must have!
