Our grandson reciently came to live with us, nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty.The day  our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help. About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet.As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! He is now doing very well with his training ! The product is well constructed, easy to to set up, and easy to use !
