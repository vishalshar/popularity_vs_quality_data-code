After having a 7 week love/hate relationship with this thing, I discovered that I could turn it off by holding the heart for 4 "Mississippi's"!!! You don't have to open the Velcro back to stop the music. Which is a great discovery since it solved the mystery of why it only plays for a few minutes/seconds sometimes. If it's unknowingly squished up against baby's shoulder or belly for four seconds, it turns off. Now I'm not going crazy wondering what's wrong with the silly thing! It also solved the problem of letting it run for 11 minutes, or opening up the back, every time you toss it on the couch, squish it in the diaper bag, or accidentally sit on it. I still dislike that you can't change the volume level, set it to just vibrate,(although mine's done it randomly 3 times and I can't figure out why), and I've had to change the batteries twice in 7 weeks. But my baby can't resist it even during a full on I've-been-awake-way-too-long crying spell. So I have to love it a little bit. Maybe the battery life will be better knowing that I can turn it off quickly and easily. Hope this helps someone- knowing yours isn't defective, you're probably just pushing on it.
