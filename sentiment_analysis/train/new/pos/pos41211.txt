I recently converted our keekaroo right height chair from the infant insert to the comfort cushions.  I hesitated to buy this cushion set because the reviews are horrible.  I am very happy with the set.  I will admit, getting the back cushion into place is a bit difficult and the video makes it look like you should just pop it into place.  It definitely takes manuevering. The seat plate needs lowered and flipped over, and a metal bar needs to be removed in order for the bottom cushion to fit properly.  Once everything is adjusted, the chair looks great.  My daughter loves her "new" chair.  We have had this chair since 2013 and We will have it for many years to come.  My daughter was able to use the infant insert until nearly 3yrs of age!  It is fantastic!!
