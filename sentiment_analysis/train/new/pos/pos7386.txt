My son loves these! I breast fed my son as long as I can and he go until he was 6months old when I couldn't bring him to work anymore (which is the age of 6mo), he got attach to these nipples. I was working long hours and break lunch to feed him and back to work. These nuk nipples I would recommend for a baby getting off breastfeeding cause they're almost like the supply cups too and he also has good teeth. We all(moms) know how our babies get attach to bottles and these are close to sippy cups too, not all babies can use this cause some have to use bottles recommended by there doctor like my youngest daughter. But anyway these are the best I love using them for my son and he likes them too!
