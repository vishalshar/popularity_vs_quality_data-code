This turtle is very cute. It seems well made, considering it is a plastic toy, and both of my kids (ages 11 months and almost 5 years) love it for bath time. Unfortunately, the head is a squirt toy, like a rubber ducky, and those are notorious for mold growth. I did not realize this was the case when I purchased the turtle and I'm not sure I still would have had I known. It seems unnecessary for this toy as the head is hard to squeeze because it's attached to a plastic ring anyway and a head with no holes in it would have been just as fun. For the $2 I paid - thanks to a Facebook deal - it was worth the cost. Maybe $3. I don't think it's worth full price since it will need to be tossed in a couple of months.
