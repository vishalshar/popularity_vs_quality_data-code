I'm glad I bought this for my child. I am tire of seeing his seat sitting on the bathroom floor or on top of his stool. With girls you can leave the seat on the toilet but with boys they have to learn to raise the toilet sit up when needing to urinate. I would've given it a five star but was a bit disappointed ob the hook because its not wide enough for the seat we have and I have to place the toilet seat in a certain way to fit in between the toilet tank and the wall.
