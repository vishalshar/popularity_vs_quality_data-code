I bought two pressure mounted gates for our stairways to try to contain our 9 month old baby. I bought the Summer Infant Step to Secure Gate and Kidco pressure mounted gate. I knew I would probably end up liking one more then the other.  I installed the Step to Secure one first, I was shocked how easy it was, the gate is very sturdy, and looks great! I then opened the Kidco gate and it is terrible in comparison. There were rust spots on it and the directions on how to put the thing together are impossible to understand. When I eventually got the thing assembled I realized that the door did not line up with the frame and would not shut. It is being returned and I am getting another Summer Infant Gate!
