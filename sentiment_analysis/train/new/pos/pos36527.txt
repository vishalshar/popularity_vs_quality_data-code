Solid construction, easy "go" fun with no batteries.  I got this for my 15-month-old for Christmas and she liked it right away.  You can just push it along, or push down on the dog's back (using your weight to help you if you're tiny).  If you do that, the legs are forced apart and a spring is stretched, so that when you let go the front wheels pull the dog along.My only suggestion would be to make the gearing lower.  As-is, the dog has a "high" gear, meaning when you let go the dog goes fast, but has little pulling power--really needs to be on a smooth floor like linoleum.  If it used a lower gear, the dog wouldn't go as fast, but would have more power, to pull along on carpet.
