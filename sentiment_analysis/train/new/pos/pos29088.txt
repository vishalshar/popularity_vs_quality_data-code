This hooded butterfly bath towel has taken a daily beating from our youngest for several months. Despite getting used daily and washed up to three times a week, the towel has held up extremely well. The colors remain vivid, the seams intact, and the material nearly as soft as it was when purchased.Despite the impressive durability, I have to give it four stars due to the lack of plushness/absorbency I would expect from a $20-$30 towel. The material is not terribly thin, but far from luxuriously thick. Additionally, this product would likely be best suited for children 18m (tad big) to 8y (tad small).Overall, I do have to say that both the kids and parents were happy with this purchase and would recommended it, despite the previously discussed discrepancy.
