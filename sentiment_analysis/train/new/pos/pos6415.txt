I almost didn't buy this pad because another reviewer said it didn't fit their Peg PÃ¨rego Pliko Mini.  I bought my Pliko Mini in June 2013 and it does fit if you look at the harness carefully.In order to thread the harness straps through the slots on this pad, the shoulder straps need to be separated from the main harness buckle.  To do this, unclasp the main harness buckle and look at the plastic piece that connects the shoulder strap to the waist strap - it's shapes a bit like an "E".  The shoulder straps slide down and disconnect off the top part of the "E" with a slight tug.  Slide them off, thread the shoulder and waist straps through the corresponding slots in the liner, reconnect and you're good to go!I purchased the Green liner and it coordinates with the Plinko Mini Aloe color well.  It's a lighter color, but looks good overall.  The pad is slightly longer than the Pliko Mini's foot rest, but the seams and folds are in the right place for a good fit that doesn't shift around.I love having stroller liners to give my baby a little extra cushion, and something that can be easily removed and washed if there's a spill or we smear sunscreen on it by accident.  It's an inexpensive way to keep your stroller looking nice for a long time.You can fold the Pliko Mini with this liner in place, but it gets a little bunchy.  No big deal.
