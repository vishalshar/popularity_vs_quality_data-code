I was actually impressed by this inflatable considering the affordable price. My daughter was born at the beginning of December and we left it out in the front of our house for about a month. It stayed firmly in place and still looks great. I live in Florida so no issues with snow, but it did hold up against the Florida sun and rainstorms. The inflatable is pretty big in size. I've attached a picture to show you what it looked like in our front lawn. I wish I knew someone else that was having a girl because I'd happily give it to them. It's still in perfect shape after using for 1 month.
