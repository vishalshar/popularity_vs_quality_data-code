Like it very much so far, seat goes back far so the boys can drink and hold the bottle easily (can also place the chair under counter when not in use this way so it takes up less room). Changing seat position is easy so I can go from bottle to solids to play easily. Fabric is easy to remove and wash, straps are a bit of a struggle to take apart for laundering.  Strangely the leg divider is on the table, not on the chair. Not an issue with the kids seating, just storing the table is cumbersome with this big thing sticking out of the table bottom.  The wheels move well and the whole chair flattens nicely for storing.  Overall, I'm pleased.
