I had a clean car. I have three kids. I no longer have a clean car. This helps keep stains off the seat and protects the expensive foam in the seat from getting permanently damaged from the car seats. It will not protect the fabric in the ceiling from crayons, yogurt, milk, boogers, projectile vomit, mysterious traveling turds, blood, cheerios, or unicorn kisses. But the seat is protected from all of those things, except unicorn kisses. Unicorns are magical.
