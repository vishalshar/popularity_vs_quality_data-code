We were looking for a book stand that didn't take up space.  Although this doesn't fit our daughter's close to 100 books (!), it fits a REALLY good amount, although we haven't counted. Aside from the space saving feature, One of the best things is that our kiddo loves to go searching for her books because it is at eye level for her.  The secret is to not over-stuff the shelves, so that they or you can move the books side to side and see what's hiding behind the other.  As for the other books, they are put away in her closet and I just rotate them randomly.  She's always happy to see some book that she hasn't read in a while amongst the new ones.
