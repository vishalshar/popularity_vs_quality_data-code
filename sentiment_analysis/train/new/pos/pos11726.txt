Our GGD is a super fan of Elmo and this was a real winner at her recent visit. The sheet was fitted and covered the crib mattress very well, the quality was good. The pillow case was larger than a standard pillow and about 15%+/- was folded over. The pillow graphics were very good and the sheet while also good lacked the welcoming Elmo appeal.The packaging/shipment was flawless and the pricing was very competitive. Recommend with seller.
