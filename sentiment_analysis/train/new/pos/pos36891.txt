The first thing I will say is that skip hop makes cute products that kids love. This item looks exactly like the pictures and my 3 y/o daughter loves it. It hasn't been on trips yet, but Im looking forward to it getting more use in the months ahead.Likes:CuteVibrantFunMaterials well constructed, and seem durableMultiple options for portability and carry (handle/wheels/carry strap)Opportunities:Ears, for the moment, snag on the dog-bone-shaped zipper pulls when passing over either ear, in either direction. Im hoping this goes away as the bag settles and isn't so new.Pockets - one large one on the front, and one unsecured side pocket. I wish there were a couple more ways to divide the space within/on the bag. An easy addition would be a secured zipper pocket on the outer opposing side. They could even add a mesh stretchy liner on the inside back or front flap, etc. Just something to help keep the bag more tidy.Overall this bag is a big hit and the opportunities for improvement are nit-picky at best; if it was refined again with these wishes for next year I would buy a second one in a heartbeat.
