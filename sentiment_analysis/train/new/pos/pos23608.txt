i had 2 of these during pregnancy and they were a "must have." I traveled a lot with my infants and this was perfect for nursing discretely on the go. The fabric is high quality and I never had any issues with stains, tears, pulls, hem stitching, etc. these held up well very in the washer and dryer. The rigid neck opening was perfect because it holds the fabric over, but not against baby's head. My infants liked to have fresh air while nursing and would push a towel or blanket off. This, they were perfectly happy to nurse underneath. Each one I had lasted through 2 separate babies who each lasted about a year. They were still in perfect condition after #2 was done.
