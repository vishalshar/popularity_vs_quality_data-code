I've bought several mittens for my daughter who is now 3.5 months old. These are the best, not too big, not too small so her hands can stretch out and also be comfortable in fist; not too tight, not too lose as they do not create marks at the wrist and do not fall off. I've bought 12 pairs, white and pink, and will buy at least 1 more 6 pair. My daughter's hands are always cold and she's always scratching so comfortable mittens that stay on are a necessity.
