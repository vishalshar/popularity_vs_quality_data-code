We bought this monitor after having our third child and moving to a new neighborhood.  Our old monitor worked well but picked up our neighbors' monitors and conversations.  The design is excellent, very small and portable, and it drops into a charging cradle like a cordless phone, so nothing to plug in.  Since two parent units (and chargers) are included, we leave one upstairs and one downstairs - a great convenience eliminating the need to tote one unit back and forth.  Even though our house is chock full of cordless phones and has a wireless computer network, we have virtually no static or interference of any kind, and the monitor picks up every sound with great clarity.  It has a few minor drawbacks, though.  Light sleepers will find that the lowest volume setting is not low enough in comparison to other monitors, making the baby's every move sound very loud in the middle of the night.  The battery time, while acceptable, could be better (and is noticeably less than our prior monitor).  Also, the LED lights are bright and may keep some people awake at night (and may contribute to battery drain when off the charging cradle).  All in all, though, this is a great monitor and I recommend it highly.
