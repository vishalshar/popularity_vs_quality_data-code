This is a cute little tray that fits loosely on tray-compatible pods.  If a large child were to push on the tray it might snap off.  If the pommel on your pod is removable then this will more than likely work.  Older models without straps cannot be used with this.  I will be purchasing small self adhesive Velcro to adhere the foam mat to the tray, as it currently does not stay on.
