I read the other reviews here and despite some negative reviews, especially about the seat-back adjustment, the stowage capacity, and the height of the handles, I bought it anyway. I couldn't be more pleased with this stroller. The seat-back is entirely adjustable -- I'm not sure what problems other reviewers had, but in my case it goes from nearly flat to 90 degrees. The stowage capacity is small, and it is hard to access, but IT'S A STROLLER! It isn't meant to carry a load of groceries. I found the stowage to be plenty big to carry the basic supplies you need when out with a child (diaper stuff, baby carrier, etc.) On the plus side, it has a great cup holder and a zipper pouch up top for things like sunglasses, keys, wallet, etc. I'm just over 6' tall, and the handles work great for me, and my wife is 5'-5" and they work fine for her, too. The sun hood is not "fully adjustable," it's either open or closed, but I don't find that to be a problem. It's very light and maneuvers well and folds-up easily and small. Overall, a great stroller at a great price.
