These are amazing, I have children that might be part hamster and love to chew on their crib rails... We tried the rubber sticky covers, but they just pulled them off and chewed on them.  Once I saw these I just had to order them.  Yes they are expensive, but they saved our crib from certain destruction.  Plus they look cool, if you get the color that would fit your childs room.  We recenlty converted the crib into a toddler bed, which has a hard board on the edge as a "barrier" to help keep the child on the bed, so I tied the railing cover over that and it is working great!  I just wish I had gotten them 6 years ago for my first son, who completely ruined his crib.
