We recently bought this pad for our changing table in the blue color. It's very soft and fits well with our pad, which was made by another company. Another viewer was right about the lack of slits to pull the straps through to hold the baby. However, our son isn't extremely squirmy so we don't use the straps anyways. He hates it more if we use them and he's more still if we don't. Overall, we like this cover, especially for it's cost.
