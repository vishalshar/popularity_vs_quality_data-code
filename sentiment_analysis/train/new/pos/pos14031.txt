I was looking for a gate to go on wrought iron stair railings (wrought iron on both sides of the gate) and noticed that most gates need special attachments for this, or just won't work at all on railings.  I couldn't believe when I stumbled upon this one - the price was just amazing and it came with all the necessary parts!This gate is easy to install - you basically attach 4 "holders" using either screws or sticky tape.  The holders are just areas that the gate uses as pressure points - they keep the gate from moving around while it's in place.  I did it by myself and it took a total of 15 minutes.Once the holders were installed, you just put the gate in using the pressure mounting system.  This is a little annoying since you need to make sure the gate is perfectly aligned with the holders, and it's a bit difficult to do alone.Taking the gate down is very easy (pull and turn the lever to release the pressure lock, then close it and put it to the side).Because it's annoying to put the gate up though, we end up not using it as often as we should.  It would be a perfect gate for low traffic areas, but in high traffic, it's just a pain to keep putting it back on.  It takes at least 2-3 minutes to attach it properly (maybe a little less if you have help from somebody else)So while this gate is great for what it is, it doesn't fully serve my purposes which is why I had to give it 4 stars.I will have to buy another gate for the bottom of my stairs, but I will keep this one to be used at a lower-traffic location.
