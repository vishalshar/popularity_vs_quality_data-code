You should see a small plastic bag with two white plastic objects inside of it. One of them looks like a fork, the other looks like a plug. Now look at your seating disk. There is a small round white thing that looks like a valve. It's not a valve, it's a plug. You can't stick anything in there. You cannot blow into it. It's a duplicate plug. It's the same as the plug that's in the small plastic bag.To inflate your seating cushion. Use that white plastic fork to remove the duplicate white plug that's already in your seating disk. Blow into it (don't worry, you probably won't get poisoned). Replace the plug, using either of your two same plugs. And that's it.Edits...As others have said, you might experience some back pain until you get used to it. If you do experience any new back pain, exercise caution and put the device aside for a day or longer before continuing.It just failed, cracked at the seam. It lasted about eight months (160 pounds). But that's okay, it was a great introduction to an air filled seat cushion.
