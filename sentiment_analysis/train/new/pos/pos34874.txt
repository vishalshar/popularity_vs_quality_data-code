Our five year old daughter has been sucking her first finger since before she was born. I actually have an ultrasound photograph of her with it in her mouth, and one of her five minutes old, sucking away on that first finger. While it was adorable to see her sucking on it with her bunny snuggled up next to her face, her teeth were starting to really buck out in the front. Plus, she is starting kindergarten this fall and her dad and I agreed it was time to break the habit.We gave her a choice--this device or the nasty tasting stuff that you paint on your nails. Of course, she chose this. We decided to start using it after school got out so she wouldn't be embarrassed. We talked to her about it for a week leading up to the first day. Then, finally, on it went. She was fine for the first whole day. Then it came time for bed and she went into full-on melt down mode and wanted it OFF. I mean kicking and screaming and throwing herself on the floor kind of stuff, which is unlike her. It made me think of a junky going into the DTs. We calmly explained that this was her choice, that we agreed on it, and we let her do her thing. Finally, after an hour, she calmed down, picked herself off the floor, and never said another word about it.She wore it full time (and I mean 24/7 unless I was washing it) for 35 days. At the end, we took it off and she was done. No finger sucking. No desire to finger suck. Completely done. Aside from the initial meltdown, it was very unobtrusive. Sometimes people would ask her how she hurt her finger, as it tends to look a little like a brace of some sort. She would matter-of-factly state that she used to suck her finger and that this was helping her stop. How adorable is that?It needs to stay on. It needs to stay on for the full 30 days. And if you do that, it works. Loved this thing.
