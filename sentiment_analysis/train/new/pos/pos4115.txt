I love these bottles! They have saved my life! I have been breast feeding my son since he was born. He wouldn't  take ANY of the bottles i got him without a melt down. As I become frustrated being that I needed him to take to the bottle. I was panicking because I needed to leave my son with others while I returned to work. I watched this one YouTube video of the tommee tippee bottle and the woman showed her son drinkin from it. As I looked to see how he was latched on,it looked just like a latch on to the breast. I ordered tommee tippee after having no success with avent. Love the anti colic portion Of these  bottles. My son had very bad gas that I had to treat with gripe water. Even thought it took him about a week to get used to the bottle it surely beat the 2mons of not taking the other bottles. Since using tommee tippee there have been no gas issues(one less than to worry about)the anti colic really works. Great thing all tommee tippee bottles come wit the anti colic option no matter the style. Tommee tippee is a life saver to moms who are breast feeding! My son loves these bottles which is most important. Purchase this brand u will be so happy! Good luck!
