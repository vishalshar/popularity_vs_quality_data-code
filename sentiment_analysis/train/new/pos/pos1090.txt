Our front crib rail is 4 inches high, which is the maximum size for this product, so I was a little worried the fit might not be right. (The cover is 10 inches wide, including 1 inch of velcro on each side). It fits perfectly around and velcros on tightly. It IS a little short leaving 2 inches of rail exposed at one end but this hasn't been a problem for us.I don't care for the toy loops but they don't get in the way or anything so I ignore them. I have washed this several times (since it is always getting chewed on) and lay it out to dry with no wear and tear on the cover. It is lightly padded which is nice, I don't worry about him damaging his teeth and it makes a nice place to rest my arm while I rub his back at night.
