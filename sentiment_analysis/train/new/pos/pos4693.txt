I found the other reviews so helpful and I don't have much to add, but just wanted to add to the discussion.My little guy is 4 1/2 months old.  We just started using the stroller, even though it's technically on the early side, but everything looks safe and comfortable.  I use this stroller for long walks on suburban/city sidewalks with stops for errands.Pros:Very compact footprint--fits anywhereEasy to carry up/down a few stairsEasy to get in/out of stores and fits well at a restaurant tableGreat, full coverage sun/rain canopyNice kid pockets for toys/adult pockets for keys/cell phoneSmooth pushing with two handsDon't kick the wheels, and there's no back bar in the way.Great color/fabric (I got yellow, which is more of an orangey yellow.)Sporty style--looks more expensive than it is.Easy to use harness/quick to snap baby in.Cons:Have to tip it for larger sidewalk bumps so you don't trip on them--easy to do, so not a huge issueHard to push one-handed on bumpy sidewalks--this is only a problem if I am carrying my iced coffee because. . .. . .pouches do not really work as cup holders.  They are as good as it gets for fabric pouches, but can't compete with a hard plastic holder.  I think I'll buy one separately.When seat is reclined, basket is hard to get to--not a flaw, just a trade-off for having a good recline.  I can't use this for a full shopping trip, but it's fine for one or two small bags.I was between this and the City Mini until I read the reviews (was worried about kicking the back of the mini.)  I am so happy with the decision!  I don't think this stroller could get much better without adding to the weight or the price tag.
