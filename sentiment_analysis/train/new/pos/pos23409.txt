Pretty easy to match up the snaps, as there are no directions, but that's Phil and Teds.  I wish I had realized there is a cover for the sports/originals, vs. the explorer/hammerhead.  I have an explorer, and it fits, but there is more Velcro on the awning of my stroller, as the Velcro snagged my shade, and the explorer is meant to have a zip on shade.  I would recommend attaching the rear shade first, and then the front shade, and snap the bottom first and work your way up.  I have the bottom unsnapped and folded up and into the awning shade closed up.
