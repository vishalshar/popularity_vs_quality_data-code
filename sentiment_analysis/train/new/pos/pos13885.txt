I bought these diapers because a friend was using them and loved them. I thought I would give them a shot. At first, I did not understand the inserts and why they were better than the all-in-ones that other companies were offering. After trying a different brand all-in-one and having it leak all over me and the baby, not to mention it was soo bulky, I decided that these were the best cloth diapers. I intend on buying more!
