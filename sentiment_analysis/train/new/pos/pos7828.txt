I ordered this as our sole baby-monitor. I have an iPad and iPod and my Husband has a Samsung Smartphone, on which we were planning on using as the monitor. When we (finally) got it set up we were disappointed that the audio did not work on our computers or phones/tablet. In order to get audio on the computer you must download a program, which we were not willing to do. We found an app that supported the LOFTEK brand, but it did not provide Audio either. We were disappointed and considered sending it back.However, after submitting a 3-star rating for the seller-feedback we were contacted swiftly by LOFTEK Customer Support. They suggested an app that does support Audio for iPhones and iPads (although it is a purchased app; not the FREE version). After downloading that app we have a great Audio/Visual Monitor for our baby's nursery. I suggested to the Customer Service Support that they make it clear in the product description that this app is necessary for audio use, and consider developing their own app or working with one already developed to provide free use to purchasers of LOFTEK cameras.Now I am not disappointed in this purchase, but I did have my doubts that could have easily been avoided had the suggested app been made clear from the beginning.
