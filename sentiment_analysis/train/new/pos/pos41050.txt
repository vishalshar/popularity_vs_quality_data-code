My son loved this activity center. He was a very active infant and this worked perfectly. He could sit and bounce or spin, although he preferred standing. All of the little toys were engaging, and he'd spend several minutes just talking to himself in the little mirror. The fabric on this was easy to wash, and I would take the seat out and give all the plastic parts a good scrub down in the tub at least once a month. This is definitely a must have for a mom with an infant that likes to stay busy. I would have never gotten anything done without it.
