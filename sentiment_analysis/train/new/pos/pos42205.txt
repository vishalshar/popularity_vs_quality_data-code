I have a Graco Fast Action Jogger which has a large visor but it doesn't come forward enough. I have the tangerine/orange accents model and the orange sun shade matches well.The shade fits well,  the only problem I ran into was not being about to have the shade all the way forward but the fault is with the stroller.  The visor doesn't lock in its extended position and it easily folds back on its own.  I just position the shade a bit further back and it works great.This keeps the sun off my very fair skinned daughter and she can still see out plenty below it. Even when the sun in lower in the sky,  she's protected.The shade is very light weight and comes with a mesh case which is necessary if you need to remove it. It's folds up easily into the case and takes up very little room.I would highly recommend this product.
