I appreciate having products like this available to nursing moms. I have only had to use this about 10 times in the 4 months since my daughter has been born (mostly because we stay home a lot), but it works well for the job. My friend even borrowed it while we were out and about because she had forgotten hers. I like the fabric design and the adjustable strap. It has kind of a stiff upper edge so you can keep it somewhat folded out, which makes it easy to see the baby from the top, but others can't see. I think this is a great product, but could easily be made with some simple sewing. If you want to pay the money instead, though, go with this one!
