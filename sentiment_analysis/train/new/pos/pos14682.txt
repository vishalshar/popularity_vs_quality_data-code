My son is nearly 6 lbs and I bought these to offer a size of prefolds that he would grow into. These diapers are well made and fit him well when I fold the front back so they are snug. I find that these diapers clean up very well with just washing and machine drying with no lasting stains.As my son is at the minimum sizing for these diapers, I cannot yet comment on sizing for babies closer to the max size (15lbs). I will update this review as my son grows to keep you updated as to the sizing. I have included some pictures showing the size of this diaper after prewashing and several uses.
