I have very busy twin toddlers. Old enough to be able to get into the fridge and freezer. They like to open the freezer door and hang from it and swing. Nice... I've been through a few other types of fridge locks already but they figure them out quickly. These, however, have done their job. They stick to the fridge firmly and were a snap to apply.I like that these have two ways to lock. Not only is there the gray button to keep out the really young ones but still allowing ease of opening but there is also an extra little button that will give the locks an extra measure of security. When the extra button is engaged tightly my little ones can not get it open no matter how hard they try. They almost have it figured out how the second button works, BUT... those little toddler fingers just don't have the strength to push hard enough to get it disengaged. Easy for my adult fingers but impossible for them. So, even if they do get the concept of "how" I can still sit back and relax when they are in the kitchen and not have to worry about any broken egg, mustard, sesame oil surprises spread all over the kitchen floor any time soon.These can be used on anything that has a surface that the puffy sticky back can adhere to. So they are very versatile for many childproofing needs.I do want to add one thing. If you use these on the fridge I would advise you to adhere the grey female piece to the door edge and the white male piece to the fridge it self. That way you can open the lock with one hand. I wish I would have thought of that first because now I have to set what ever is in my hand down so I can use that hand to push the unlock button while the other hand pulls the fridge door open.
