I never write reviews, I'm always the type that reads the reviews if products that others write before making a purchase. But this katan wrap is something I felt I had to review. I am 5'1 & about 125 pounds, & I ordered an XS, in the denim katan. One thing I noticed it the baby katan's denim that is pictured up is not as dark as the actual sling. The jean sling is more of a light jean color opposes to the dark color, but it doesn't look cheaply made at all. I was skeptical on buying it because sometimes my newborn (2 months) gets fussy & doesn't like the be touched so I wasn't sure if the katan would be a good fit for him, but I was wrong. He loves he, he falls asleep every single time I put him in it. Once he's sleep inside the Katan, I can cook, do light cleaning, & laundry. One thing I like about the katan is that it's so easy to put on, over your head, split the loops, pull one side down, put him in on side of the loop, and slide the other loop over him & he's in: locked with security. You can also use the sash for a sense of extra security. I purchased the katan, because my husband & I were going flying to Birmingham, AL. I needed a wrap or something to securely hold him while in the air, so that I could feel better that he was safe opposes to me holding him the whole flight & during bumpy landings. I used the katan & my newborn son slept through the whole 3 hour flight. He felt so secure, to be close to me & being in the cradle position made him feel as if he was being held. I love the katan sling & will be getting for any of my friends who have future children, because it's an investment that was well worth it . . .
