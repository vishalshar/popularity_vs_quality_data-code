Back in college only the privileged kids had those fancy Mitutoyo digital calipers.  Fast forward to 2010 and these things have become accessible to the masses not just the well-to-do.  People at work teased me for $14 SE calipers until we tested in with gauge blocks and it was dead nuts accurate! The boss went and bought a boat load of these puppies for everyone and we use them daily.  Incredible value!  Am I a nerd for reviewing digital calipers?  Yes.
