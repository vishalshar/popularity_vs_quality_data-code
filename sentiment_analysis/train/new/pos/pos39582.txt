I am writing this review after 2 1/2 years of use and I can't find a single thing to complain about. This stroller is truly one of the best strollers on the market. The versatility it has is amazing. It can be set in so many positions. My favorite is using it as a high chair but won't stop there. Have to use it to appreciate it. Well worth the $$
