I researched a lot of mats before deciding on this one. I'm very pleased with it. It is easy to wipe clean with wet cloth or wash/rinse clean under the faucet. It secures dishware to prevent some skidding (not perfect here but way better than our glass table). What I love best is the lip that is along the perimeter which you don't find on most mats. If our toddler manages to spill (or in some cases, dump) his cup or something else with liquid, the lip prevents the liquid from escaping the placemat area. The mat having some weight and slight stickiness to it has yet to be peeled completely from the table and thrown by my toddler. He has only managed to lift up the edges. This is our one and only mat for him.Update May 2015:After couple years of continued use, this is still the only mat in our home that we use for our now preschooler. It works so well and has held up to daily wiping and washing by hand. I have run it through the dishwasher (top shelf, no heat dry cycle) about once a month. The color, texture and shape have held up well. My only problem is I was hoping to use the mat we own with my second child but I may need to buy a second one as I don't think my preschooler wants to give up his mat yet.
