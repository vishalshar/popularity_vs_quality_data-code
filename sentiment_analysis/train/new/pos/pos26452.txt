In selecting toys for our 8 mo (now almost 10 mo) daughter, we wanted to have fewer toys that grow with her and are visually appealing. Blocks allow for free play, however all the ones we found were small, cheaply made, or had reviews that discussed splinters and paint chips and overall poor quality.We debated for a while because of the price. We couldn't be happier. She loves them. We love them. They are beautifully made, engraved on multiple sides, painted with non-toxic ink and not sealed (a good thing - the eventual wear and tear is better than sucking on chemical sealants).She (and we) plays with them every day; we build towers; we make words, we talk about the animals printed on the side; and they make a beautiful sound when clapped together. They are consistent in size and shape (which should not be surprising in blocks, but surprisingly it is) so building complex towers, including ones that can be loudly dismantled by selecting the single point of failure. With babies - architectural value is in the quality of creative destruction not in the stability of the construction.So far the theory of fewer toys of higher is serving us well.  Rather than 4 or 5 toys for the same money we have one set that we love... and there's less to clean up!
