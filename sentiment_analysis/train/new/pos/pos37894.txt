Last month, I took my daughter for a walk because it was finally warm enough. After about half an hour, the beautiful day turned into an incredibly windy one. I tried everything to keep my daughter warm. But, when walking into the wind, it is nearly impossible.I felt terrible. My choice was either buy a weather cover or quit going for walks lest this happen again. Of course, I chose the former and I'm so glad I did.The cover is very easy to put on. To be honest, I had to glance at the directions, but once I did, putting on the cover was a breeze (see what I did there?). This allows me to just keep the cover in the under carriage so it's always there just in case.That brings up a great point. The cover folds up easily and is relatively small making it possible to have on you during the windy and rainy months.We've used this a few times already and my daughter doesn't mind it at all. I love that it keeps her nice and snuggle warm no matter how cold I am while battling the wind. I highly recommend buying this
