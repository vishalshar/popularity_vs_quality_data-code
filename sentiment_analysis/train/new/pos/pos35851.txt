Fisher-Price Potty On-the-Go - GrayTwenty dollars is a bargain for this great product.  We make frequent road trips with our 4-year-old daughter, who is afraid of the automatic flush toilets at most highway rest stops.  This potty replaces a Baby Bjorn potty chair, really meant for indoor use, that took up valuable trunk space and required either myself or my husband to find a discreet location to dump out the pee.  The way I see it, here are the best features of this product:-compact and discreet: you could take this potty just about anywhere with its tasteful carrying case slung over your shoulder without anyone being the wiser.  Also, it takes up very little trunk space.-no expensive or hard-to-find refills to buy: simply keep the bag stocked with 4 gallon trash bags and some disposable nursing pads that can be purchased at any supermarket.-bag has lots of handy pockets for storing bags and absorbent pads, plus extra room for a package of tissues and some hand sanitizer.-my daughter loves it and even wants to use it in the house!If there are any drawbacks to this product, I haven't found them yet!  I would have paid twice as much!
