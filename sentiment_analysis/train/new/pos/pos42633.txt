Color description is not accurate. Color shown on box is blue but described as green and vice versa. Select color shown when purchasing.Great for 0-6 mo. old babies that need to strengthen upper body, neck, and stabilize head. Some babies dislike tummy time because they are not strong enough to hold themselves up. The Tumzee is inclinated and has safety belts so baby doesn't slide off. Mine was returned due to wrong color and no longer needed since our baby had just started lifting himself up and holding his head steady.
