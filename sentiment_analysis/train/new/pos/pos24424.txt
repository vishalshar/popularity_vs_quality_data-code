I'm not partial to the public bathrooms on our favorite beach and I shudder at the idea of using port-o-potties (ugh!).  When a friend brought a similar product to the beach one day, it was like having an epiphany!  Why didn't I think of that?!?We have only had the occasion to use ours 3 times - mainly at the park.  I just store it in the back of my SUV and it's readily available when we need it. It takes about 30 seconds or so from the time you pull it out of the carrying case until it's ready to use.  I set it up in the back of the SUV and have my kids climb aboard and take care of business - it sure beats trying to find a clean potty where there is none to be had!I specifically chose this item for the carrying case.  I haven't really needed to carry it with me yet, but I'm sure it'll come in very handy when that time comes.  The case comes with a couple of pockets for the pads and disposable bags.  It's also handy for a small bag of wipes or tissue.Overall a great buy!
