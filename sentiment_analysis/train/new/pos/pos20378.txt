I obtained these teethers to place in party bags for my child's birthday. We have a few friends whom just had babies in the last year and I figured it would be fun to include the younger little ones with a favor bag of their own. I did give one to our daughter before using the rest as favors and she loves it. She is still teething and has the need to bite on something from time to time. She loves Elmo so this really caught her attention and gave her something to focus on when going through those moments of pain. I think it has really done it's job and she is genuinely amused by the design. Her birthday theme is Elmo so I think our baby guests will enjoy & find good use for them too.
