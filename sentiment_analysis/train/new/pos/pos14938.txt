Easy to install and worked great. Completely invisible. The only issue I could imagine is if you don't want to put screws in your cabinets for any reason. Other than that, great product. We had a plastic heart shaped one on the cabinets before and I hated it. easy to break open of you pull. This is so much better. and unless you can see it clearly from the top, your kids will NOT figure out how to open the cabinet.  Just remember to adjust them properly. the height of the vertical screw is pretty important for proper operation. Once it is set though, it works very time. Even closes without needing to be pushed down.
