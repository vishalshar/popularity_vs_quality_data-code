I've been using this diaper bag for 2 months & love it!  I looked at several diaper bags online & in stores & finally settled on this one (other one I liked was the Storksak Olivia & another from Pottery Barn).  I'm glad I settled on this one because of the cross body strap.  It's so easy to throw it on when heading out of the house or getting out of the car & not having to worry about it slipping off my shoulder.  The 2 straps are long enough to put on my shoulder when I need to though so a great option to have.  Although I can carry a lot (usually diapers, wipes, changing pad, change of clothes, pacifiers, 2 burp cloths, bottles, my Hobo wallet & sunglasses), I always seem to wish I had a little more room.  I think it'd get too heavy so is probably good it's not bigger.  The only thing I haven't liked about this bag is that I try to slip a big water bottle for myself into one of the side pockets, & the material of the bag kind of sticks & makes it difficult to slide in & out.  I'm so happy with this purchase though!
