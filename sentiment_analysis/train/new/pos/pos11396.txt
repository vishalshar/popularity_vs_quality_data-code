I would rate this product a 5, but I had difficulty getting the sides to stay up. It has the same structural set up as a pack-n-play and I dislike those as well. Otherwise, this comes as two pieces (frame and mattress) and the mattress is very nice and soft. A big plus is that the mattress attaches to the support so that the mattress doesn't shift. The bad news is that the velcro doesn't work if you use a sheet.I also love the fact that this is mesh on all sides unlike the co-sleepers that you typically find. My daughter frequently looks out the sides to make sure she is not alone and will then fall back asleep. Overall, this is a great product and my daughter sleeps in it every night.I have recommended this instead of a traditional bassinet to everyone I know that is having a baby.
