I cannot stress how much I love MAM bottles. We went through playtex, dr. Brown, Evenflo, avent, and finally I tried the MAM bottles and we've used them ever since. Our little guy loves them and has never had a problem; wish we'd have tried them first. All the other brands were wonderful they just aren't for our little guy. We started with the anti-colic but quickly got tired of all the pieces, but that is all the stores around me had. When I went online I found just regular MAM bottles, of course I snatched them up quickly and I couldn't be happier! Now our little one tries to help hold his own bottle so this is perfect to encourage him to help but also the 8o size is going to be a lot easier to travel with than the 11 oz which aren't bad they're just big. So excited just put off on how hard this product is to find.
