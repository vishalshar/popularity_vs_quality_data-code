I have tried lots of brands of cloth diapers. When I got started I bought two of everything. Ok maybe not EVERYTHING, but lots of things. Swaddlebees, bumgenius, fuzzibunz, cheap pockets, and a lots of other various pre-folds. I have been using cloth on my 2 1/2 year old since birth and I keep coming back to these diapers. The covers were great at the newborn stage, but I felt like the pre-folds were too bulky. In an older baby/toddler I used these with flip covers. I eventually sold off everything else I bought, and used the econombum pre-folds exclusively (inside flip covers). They have held up well, they are easy to use, and they clean up easily. They are cheap, and they work great! WIN WIN, WIN!
