Our daughters used these cups for about 1.5 years. It worked great with our oldest daughter (used from almost 2 yrs til almost 3.5 yrs old) which is a much calmer girl who don't really care to spill and be messy. Our youngest (used from about 8-9 months old til just over 2 years old), well, she found out pretty fast that if she shakes it while holding upside down she gets out fun water to play with! Or, even better, if she push up on the "button" it will pour out! ;) She certainly had quite a lot of fun with this cup. Now, if your child is calm, and don't care to explore and spill as much as my youngest, then this cup is pretty good as a transition to a regular cup. It is easy to drink from. And, it does spill slower than a regular cup without any stoppers at all. So it might still help if your child likes to spill... If you're there to help them learn not to spill. The parts stayed strong the entire time, the plastic faded a little bit, but nothing too bad.
