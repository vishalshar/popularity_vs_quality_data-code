Love this toy for my son who is four months. I didn't read anything about it before I bought it except for the reviews and fell in love when I received it as my son started playing with it. I bought this toy for him to use in his mobile high chair for small entertainment while trying to do a little pick up around the house and he loves it. I have other toys from this collection and with pleased results decided to try out this one. Everything with the toy is great except for the suction as others have stated in previous reviews, but I decided I would give it a try anyways. Having a little boy I would expect him to be a little rough but he has another suction toy that sticks with no issues. The suction on this toy last very bit of a couple of minutes if even that and then its popping of and my son even hits himself in the face from time to time with surprise because of the poor suction. Other than that I have no complaints about this toy because it does entertain and stimulate his senses so overall I am pleased
