OK, I'm that mom who is guilty of reading 10,000 reviews but never writing one. Until now. I bought this chair three years ago for my now-toddler, and as we are gearing up for kid #2 I can say this chair is the one product I've been the most satisfied with out of every baby item I've bought. It's so worth the money. Well made, sturdy, lasting, easy to clean. The mechanism to snap the tray in and out is super easy to master with one hand. It's grown with our daughter well, too. It's also super stylish and looks great in our kitchen. I will say our kid was never much of a squirmer, so I never put the straps to much use, but they seem totally fine to me! We now use this as a booster chair at our dinner table and it's still perfect. Overall a high quality, lasting product
