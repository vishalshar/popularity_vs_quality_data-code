This whole set is a dream.  I absolutely love it.  We had purchased this as a new set for guests arriving with a newborn and my daughter had worn her crib set pretty well since we wash them every other week, or as needed.  I was so excited to get this and pleased with the quality.  Everything washes so well and I love that I have a back-up fitted sheet for last minute spills or stains too, they are both different so it's nice to also change the look of the crib with just the fitted sheet alone.  I'm not a fan of the duster/skirt so we've only used it once, then I removed it since it's difficult to leave in place when I change the fitted sheets out.  The colors are very sweet and the designs even sweeter.  The mobile was a hit, even with my 2yr old.  The blanket/comforter is larger than most I've seen, and have, so it was nice that it's something my daughter can use even as she grows for the next couple years if she wants to keep it.  As much as she likes her old crib blanket still, she still loves to snuggle with the blanket it came with.  I have one long side without the bumper and put the cover on the top of the rail to protect from teething, genius idea that this is a part of the set!!!!  It was a great addition to the set, for sure.  Delivery was great, packaging wonderful.
