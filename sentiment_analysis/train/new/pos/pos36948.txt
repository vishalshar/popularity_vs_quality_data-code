We use this every day to hold Dragon Baby's toys to her high chair.  (She gets a toy while I prepare her meal.)  More often than not, she chews on this strap instead of her toy - so I'm glad I went with this strap instead of another.  I like that it's machine washable (it's held up well after many washes) and that it's made from fabric instead of webbing.  If I'm using it on her car seat, I turn it around so the elastic side goes around the car seat handle, and the other side goes through her toy.  That way, it really does adjust to anything you'd want to strap a toy to.  I also got this strap in another pattern (Vintage in Blue) and the Velcro on that one is fraying; I'm not sure if it's more normal for the Velcro to stay in tact or to fray.
