I wasn't too sure about this helmet from reading the reviews. I was so nervous that my daughter would easily be able to pull it off defeating the purpose all together. When I received it in the mail it was cuter than what I had imaged. I love how this helmet is very light weight, so it isn't a strain on my daughters head. When I went to put it on her head the first time she kept wanting to play with it, so I was sure then it would be a struggle to get her to leave it alone while wearing it. So I took one of her toys that played music to distract her while I put the helmet on. Very quick and easy to slide on the helmet and attached the Velcro straps. I was amazed that after putting on the helmet and walking away my daughter kept playing with her toy, and acted like she didn't even know it was there. Now when I put on the helmet it's like she isn't wearing anything at all. She doesn't tug at it or try to remove it. My daughter is 9 months and tries to walk, so she falls and bumps her head quit often, and this helmet has saved us many tears. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! I have attached pictures of my daughter Lilly playing in her helmet. Oh and a quick note, all helmets make you sweat one way or another. It should be common sense that you can't leave this helmet on your child for long periods of time and expect their head not to sweat a little. This helmet has a ton of ventilation holes in it but if you leave it on your child for an hour they will start to sweat a little.
