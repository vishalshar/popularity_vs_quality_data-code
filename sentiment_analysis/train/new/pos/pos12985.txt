I purchased this after reading many reviews and I am not disappointed.Out of the box I was a bit confused as to how to set this up because some of the arms didnt "click" and I had no idea what I was doing wrong.  I no longer recall if there were instructions or not, but I didnt read it.  It took probably 5 minutes and it was ready.It is capable of holding a lot of bottles, nipples, caps, etc.  it rotates from the top and you can also rotate the white bottom part to make the whole thing rotate.  I have had over 10 bottles and this holds up pretty well.I dont know about glass bottles, but I have used it for the shaker bottle I use to premix the formula and it does not have an issue staying in place.If I ever need another one, I will be sure to get this same product.
