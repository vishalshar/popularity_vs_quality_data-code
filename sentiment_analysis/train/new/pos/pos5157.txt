These go with my favorite straw cups and it was great to find replacement parts PLUS A CLEANING BRUSH!!  It is so nice to have a small cleaning brush to get up into the straw in case you need to.  It comes with 2 straws, but be careful, because it says it comes with two 9oz straws but mine came with one 9oz straw and one 12oz straw. (Like the picture not the headline of the page.)  I am okay with that, because I have both size cups and I can always cut the longer straw to fit the smaller cup if I need to.  I ordered both this one and the set that claims it is for 12oz, and I am starting to think it is that you just get what they happen to grab since one set came with one of each size and the other order came with two 12oz straws.  ???  Not sure what is going on there.  If you have both sizes, it won't matter, but if you need a specific size, you may not get exactly what you want.
