In the past, I bought several different types of sippy cups. I like this one the best. My 4yr old daughter has been using these cups regularly for 1.5 yrs.PRO:-Camo design seemed random, but now I like it. Probably not intentionally done, but I think it can help my daughter to go beyond gender stereotypes of "girl toys" and "boy toys". Camoflauge in pink may help her be open to army toys and trucks. Also, these cups are great for my son too! He won't be "afraid" of the color pink and he's still very much boy if he only wants green.-3 pieces per cup: lid, cup, white valve. DOES NOT LEAK. If white valve is tightly secured in lid, then sippy cup doesn't leak. As expected the silicone piece in the white valve may get damaged or torn eventually with time. Easy to buy replacement valves, unlike many other brands which force you to buy the entire sippy cup again. The sippy cup is easy to assemble/disassemble. The white valves are eas to find in the dishwasher and do not need such a delicate touch such as other sippy cups to clean the attached silicone piece.-Durable: these things are thrown, dropped, stepped on, tripped over. Although my husband and I are not overweight, I can conclude the sippy cups are very durable.CON:-not cheap! Limited designs and colors. Bigger investment on sippy cups, but these last quite a while.-The cups are littly bulky, wider for little hands.VERDICT:If your child accepts using them regularly, then you're lucky. These cups are the best!
