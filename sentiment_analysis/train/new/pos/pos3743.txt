This cover rocks if you use it right.Sizing: Newborn fits until about 3-4 months, then size small from there on out. Medium seems like it might fit a 7-year-old, so I don't know which babies those are meant for.Use: Excellent over fitted diapers or well-secured Kissaluvs hybrid contours. Not good for prefolds.These are my favorite covers, and I own them all. This cover is economical, holds in wetness, comfy for baby (no red lines!), and very trim under clothes.
