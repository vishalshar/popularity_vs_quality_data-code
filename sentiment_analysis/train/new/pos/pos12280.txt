I have 2 Moby wraps, a ring sling, a one piece sling, a mai tei, and a baby bjorn.  The Moby was great for newborn stage but after my little one started moving around a bit more it just didn't hold her in place well and was soooo hot.  The ring and one piece slings put too much weight on one shoulder.  The mai tei is great but does get uncomfortable for me after awhile where the unpadded straps dig into my waist.  And the bjorns are so cumbersome and not good for baby's pelvis anyway.I debated between this and the Ergo and finally decided on this because it is the only soft structured carrier that babywearer.com reviews gave 5 of 5 with a decent number of reviews.  And this has pockets!!!!  One on the waist band and one that the sleep hood fits into on the front of the carrier.  Not big pockets but big enough for Id, debit card, shopping list, and an extra toy.  It fits me at 5'4" and my husband at 6'5".I actually tried to order directly from boba but they didn't have this gender neutral gray in stock.Other points:  It is still a bit warm in the lovely 95 degree weather we are having right now but it is bearable and anything would be hot.It has foot straps but I can't comment on those yet as my little one is still too little.The sleeping hood has been great - I get her sleeping out of the car seat and directly into this and put the hood on.  She will sometimes stay asleep for an hour in that.One thing i wish it had is a couple of fabric loops somewhere on the front.  My keys are on a carabiner and I would love a place to attach those and maybe a toy on a ring
