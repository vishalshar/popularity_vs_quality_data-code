I can't say enough wonderful things about this pillow. I was struggling big time with tandem nursing and frankly, beginning to hate and dread nursing my twins together until I bought this pillow when they were two months old. I love it and they love it. They are 7 months and the pillow is going strong.The best thing about this pillow for the babies is that it is cushy enough to snuggle against me and nap on, yet firm enough to support them. It is broad enough that I can nurse them hands-free. Now that they are taller and heavier, I do have to prop the pillow higher with a folded towel underneath and put a bed pillow behind it so they can't kick the headboard or couch, but no big deal.The best thing about the pillow for me is the large, full-length, supportive back rest. My back was KILLING me during tandem nursing previously and I couldn't keep regular pillows in place. Another great thing is ease of use--it buckles on in seconds. I'm able to lay the babies on the bed, climb on and buckle up, and pull them onto the pillow in a jiffy.Best twin nursing invention ever.
