When I received this product I thought, No way this is going to work - maybe I should've bought 3 or 4 kits.But this turned out to be a fantastic, inexpensive, easily portable potty training reward kit.  A parent could easily create this setup themselves with some stickers but this is attractive enough as sold. The package contains:- Approx. 8"x12" laminated, folded cardboard reward poster and a sticker sheet.- Certificate of completionThere are (5) columns of "deliverables" similar to the ones our government advertised for our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan:- Uh-oh... gotta go...- Sat on potty- Used potty- Clean and flush- Washed handsI taped the poster kid-level on the wall next to the toilet.  My kid loved putting the stickers up and felt proud.  If she didn't want to wash her hands, I'd say, "Oh well, guess I can't give you that sticker since you didn't do it..."  Then she'd rush to wash her hands.Just one kit did the trick for us but, as you can imagine, all kids are different and some factors may have contributed to our success.  I'll list them here:1) Our child has an older sibling who is potty trained.2) She was introduced to using the potty before this albeit with no consistent success.3) We were very casual about potty training.  We let it happen at her pace and never pushed for success or displayed disappointment at failures.I bought the product because it looked like a participatory way to get a child interested in succeeding with a potty.  This simple product met all expectations.
