These are the perfect size for my kids' lunch boxes (ages 4 and 2). They go to a Montessori school and they really encourage that children not use plastic (which teaches them to respect things, as glass will break if you drop it). Also, I just hate that plastic food containers wind up getting that grimy haze on them from washing and remnants of meals from long ago. The portioning is absolutely perfect for small snacks or wet fruit, which I hate to put in ziploc bags. The absolute best part about these particular glass containers are the lids - they are super kid friendly and leak proof (I use them for applesauce). There are four tabs that are easy to open and close (and also fun), and they have kind of a ridge that they sit in, so you can't put them on wrong. They are a thick glass, which is good and bad - it does make them far heavier than packing in plastic or sandwich bags. My 2 year old did throw one of these once, and while it did obviously break, the thickness of the glass seemed to make a "clean" break, and it was really only 2-3 large pieces, not a big shattered mess. Since then, they've both used them for months with no drops or breaks.
