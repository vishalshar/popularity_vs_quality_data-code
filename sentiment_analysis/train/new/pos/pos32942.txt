We bought these for the Evenflo classic glass nursers. We used the glass bottles without these silicone covers for about 6 months and never had one break, crack or chip. But when our daughter started daycare, they asked us to use silicone covers with our glass bottles.We did notice that the bottle has a "softer" landing when we drop them or when they hit against each other in the bag. No more glass on glass clanking.Cons:Hard to get on the bottle. It does not "slide" on and off. It has to be forced on and off.Makes it more difficult to read markings on the bottle. The silicone is translucent but the Evenflo markings are imprinted in the glass (no colored markings) so these make it difficult to read.Pros:Fits Evenflo glass bottles perfectly. The large siliskin fits the 8 oz Evenflo.Pretty, the gray is more of a sea glass green then a gray-gray.Protects bottleSturdy and long lastingNeutral:Easy to hold - the product description advertises it as easy to hold but  don't think it adds to that, nor does it take away.
