I love these bottles! When I found out we were having another child I was on a mission to be plastic free. I researched and I found this bottle, klean Kanteen, and Lifefactory. But, I didn't like the idea of giving a glass bottle to a baby when they get old enough to hold it by themselves. So then it was down to Klean Kanteen and Pura. I picked Pura because it can go to newborn to toddler with one bottle and had different nipple options. No more buying plastic sippies. I took the advice of other reviewers and got different nipples right away, we got MAM. Other advice, get the sleeves to go with they are really nice to have.And as far as leaking goes, just make sure that the you screw it together really tight and you won't have a problem with the 11 oz bottle. If you are thinking of getting the smaller 5 oz, we had problems with those w/ the MAM nipples, they were prone to leaking. The only thing I could see was a difference between the two... the 5 oz bottle, on the rim the steel has a brushed finish, the 11 oz is shiny. So if you are thinking you should get some 5 oz bottles too, just get these 11 oz and buy newborn nipples and save the fast nipples for later.And an added bonus, they just came out with sealing discs to make your babies bottle into a water bottle for later, or a snack container (which is what we will do for the 5 oz bottles we have). All and all I am glad I spend the money on these, I feel like I am really getting my moneys worth!
