These cups not only look awesome, but we love the design... Yes there is no sippy stopper! This is best for child development as specialists will tell you. Sippy cups promote speech issues. Children should use small cups. This also helps decrease dehydration as they don't have to work so hard to get a small drink. So i had been looking for great small cups and there are hardly any out there.The lids pop on and off easily for mom and dad, but are secure. We also like that the top helps to tech a child the cup will spill if not set down correctly without dumping a whole cup at a time. The small cup size is perfect for little mouths.
