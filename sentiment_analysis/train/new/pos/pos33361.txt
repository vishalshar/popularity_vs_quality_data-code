We did a lot of research before deciding to get this for our 5 month old. We decided to go with this one because it's organic and uses food grade polyethylene, the dual firmness (firmer for infants, softer for toddlers), and the seamless, waterproof design. For us, it was a lot to spend on a mattress, but we decided not to take any chances with the chemical flame retardants so commonly found in other mattresses - how can you really put a price on your child's health?When I put the mattress in our crib, it was a much tighter fit than I expected. I thought at first it must be because it was bigger than the old mattress, but I measured it and even stood both mattresses side by side: they were identical in size. What I learned was that our crib design actually counts on the edges of the mattress being flexible so it squeezes the mattress a little. With the Naturepedic model, the edge support is so good that it was almost impossible to squeeze the mattress into place. I did eventually shoehorn it into the right position and we've been very pleased with it.It hasn't revolutionized our daughter's sleep habits, though it certainly hasn't had a negative effect at all. More than anything, it's great to have the peace of mind that she's sleeping on something that isn't going to hurt her and is built by a company that stands behind their products.
