When my son's car seat came up missing out of our car, we didnt want to have to invest a whole lot of money into another one, but didnt want to get any junk either. Since this is our last kid, and he will soon be big enough to not be in a car seat this item did the trick. Its very nice and plush not cheap looking and it arrived sooner than we where stated.
