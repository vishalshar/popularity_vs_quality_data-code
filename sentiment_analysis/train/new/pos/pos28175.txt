These cups are superior to other "take and toss" brands whose lids snap into place.  I often found that those lids would force liquid out of the straw or straw hole when you put the lid on.  They also leaked pretty easily.  I use these every day and they work great.  My only complaint is that the straws get damaged pretty quickly (my kids chew on them) - so I throw them out after a few uses.  We use disposable straws with these cups.  Using a straw as soon as possible was important to me as a mom because using a sippy cup for too long can cause speech problems.  I also take these on trips and to restaurants where their "kids cups" aren't really spill proof.  They have saved the day more than once!  I like them so much - I sent a set to my sister for her to use with her children.
