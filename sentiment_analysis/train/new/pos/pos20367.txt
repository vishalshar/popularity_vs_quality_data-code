We've been looking for something to protect our hardwood floors from our son's mealtimes, and we found that the bestselling ones have crazy baby prints and sell for $30 or $40, ack!  Just because we have a baby doesn't mean we want our house to look like a daycare.This floor mat is a refreshing change.  It's a thick, durable, clear plastic and feels kind of like a shower curtain liner.  (Also like a shower curtain liner, the mat smelled a little when we first took it out of the package, but the odor dissipated after a while and now is gone.)  The mat protects the floor from food that (either accidentally or purposefully) falls from the high chair.  Clean up consists of a damp paper towel.  No more scrubbing at blobs of oatmeal that have dried on the floor and refuse to come off or picking up every little pea or grain of rice on the floor.The mat is a good size and fits easily in a corner underneath the high chair.  It lays flat, doesn't bunch up, and because it's clear, it doesn't even attract that much attention from our curious son.  Best of all, it costs about a third of what the others sell for, hooray!** Update:  Now that our son has outgrown the need for this mat during feeding time, we've converted it to a haircutting mat.  We just lay it on the floor, put a chair in the middle, sit the kiddo down, and cut his hair.  The hair cuts look pretty awful, but at least clean up is a breeze.  :)
