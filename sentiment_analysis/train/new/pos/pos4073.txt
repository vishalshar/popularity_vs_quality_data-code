Fifty bucks for some toy thing to put onto an already-outrageously-priced bouncer? Seriously? Yeah, that's what I said too. But I caved and my daughter thinks this thing just hangs the moon. She started using it at 8 weeks and it really did help her figure out her hands and hand-eye coordination. She'll play with this for 20-30 minutes if given the chance. So five stars to you, weird googly-eyed expensive toy thing.
