I bought this to go on our Gumdrops pacifier.  I just got it out and started using it today, but so far I love it!The metal clip is strong, reinforced with some sort of rubber-like material inside the clip to prevent slipping.  The string/loop that attaches to the binky seems extremely sturdy.  The clip looks like it'll hold well enough for its' purpose.  I mean, I wouldn't use it to go mountain climbing, but it should be just great at keeping the binky from hitting the floor.  Plus, I LOVE the fun colors the BooginHead clips come in!  Purchase the Black Swirl and Pink Polka dots and love both prints.So, two thumbs up from me on this item.  If I get a few months down the road and the product is a bust, I'll update my review. I do NOT anticipate any issues though, and look forward to getting a lot use out of it!
