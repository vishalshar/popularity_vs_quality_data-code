This is an essential item to have if you're formula feeding! I like to pre-measure formula so I can make bottles for my daughter quickly and this storage system is perfect. It takes up very little space on my counter and in my diaper bag. We are at 2.5 scoops of formula per bottle right now and it only takes up 1/4 of the containerâ€¦so each container can hold a lot of powder. My favorite thing about it is that the formula never sticks to the inside and every bit comes out because of the curved covers. It's easy to wash by hand and dries quickly and it holds up great in the dishwasher. I will definitely be purchasing more!
