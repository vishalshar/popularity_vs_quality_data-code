We bought this for my daughter for when she started sitting up by herself and crawling.  She really loves it!  She enjoys the cutout images that she can remove and play with by themselves and she also loves trying to take the mat apart.  I love being able to point at the colors and reinforce their names and I love that she has somewhere fun and comfortable to sit and play.  If I had the room, I would buy another one and connect the two together!One thing that I wish is that it wasn't so annoying to wipe clean.  There is a different texture on each square and, although it is great for developing sensory skills, this makes it difficult to simply wipe clean.  You have to make sure there is nothing stuck in any of the grooves in the patterns.  I also don't like that the musical piece does not have an on/off switch.  We have accidentally set it off a MILLION times by stepping on it and it is very annoying!!
