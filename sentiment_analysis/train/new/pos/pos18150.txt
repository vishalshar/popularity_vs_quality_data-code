My son loves to play with this activity mat. It is overall worth the price. I was initially concerned that the hard plastic was going to be thick beneath the quilt; but, there is no thick plastic beneath the mat (just three thin straps to keep the mat spread out). The quilt is too thin to place directly on a hard floor. This needs to rest on a blanket or carpet. Also, the toys are not interchangeable with other hangable toys because there are t-shaped tabs instead of loops to hold the toys.
