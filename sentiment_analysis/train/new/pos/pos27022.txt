This is a must have, we use it EVERYWHERE! Fits great in most shopping carts, especially Target. Was a little worried we wouldn't use it much when I ordered it but it's always in the back of the car even after a yr. Works great for a mid shopping nap if needed. I can easily fold this up when done while holding my child.
