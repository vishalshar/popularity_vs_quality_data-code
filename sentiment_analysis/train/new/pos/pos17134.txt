Thought that it was going to be black and white because that was what the original pictures looked like, but when it got to me, it was brown and white. Needless to say, I am just going to keep it as a back up. I haven't opened it yet, but it looks like it is very snuggly and soft for baby's skin. The color is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars. If it had arrived in black and white, I would have given it a 5 star rating!! Not what I expected, but still a great buy!
