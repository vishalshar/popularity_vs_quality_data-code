I was of the generation where you used those old blue "sucker" type aspirators.  My daughter is a doctor, and she is pregnant with my first grandbaby.  I bought this and took it to her house.  That same weekend we visited a friend of hers - also a doctor - and she had the exact same one at her house.  My daughter felt a sigh of relief that it got such a thumbs up with her friend.  Nasty noses, here we come.  I feel I'm ready for cold weather and the baby now!
