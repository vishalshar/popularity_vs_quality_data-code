I gave this mattress 4 stars because I don't want to give a bad rating because it looks like a really good mattress - not too firm, not too soft. Amazon did a great job, as always, processing the order and getting it packaged and sent out to me. My problem is that the mattress was too long for my crib. I have the Davinci Kalani 4-in-1 crib, so just a heads up to people with that crib, this mattress does not fit the crib. The mattress fits snugly in the crib but the hinges at the end of the crib in which the spring hangs from gets in the way of two corners. I tried forcing the mattress down but the hard wiring in the corners won't allow me to. If you just leave it you'll have one end of the mattress elevated up, which I think can cause a hazard for the baby. You want everything to be level so there's no rolling. I mainly made this review to warn those that get the Davinci Kalani crib to NOT get this mattress. It will not fit. Otherwise it's a good mattress. I gave it to my sister for her baby and she let me have her mattress so it worked out for me.
