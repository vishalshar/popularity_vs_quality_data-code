We purchased this blanket to have as a second one here at home.  Our son recieved one just like it from is Nana when he was born and can't live without it!  He sleeps with it, takes it everywhere, etc.  So we purchased another one here on Amazon just in case we lost the first one and to have a second one to have around.  BTW- Amazon always seems to have the cheapest prices when it comes to baby things).  This blanket is made well, is washable, sooooo SOFT and cuddly.  The bottom of the blanket is silky - a part my son just loves!  All my nieces and nephews have blankets like this one - just different animals.  So, if you're not a monkey person check out the other animals.  They are worth purchasing.  They last forever!  My 8 year old niece still has her elephant one!
