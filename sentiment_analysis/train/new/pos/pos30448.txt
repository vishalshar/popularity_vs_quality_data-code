We wanted something cute for my daughter's first "big girl bed," but wanted to stay away from princess themes or other clich√©s. This was perfect! it arrived quickly and It's very well made, tight stitching and quality fabric. It felt a little rough when I first pulled it out of the package, but after washing it, its very soft and comfortable. The comforter is big enough that I can tuck the edges a little and not have to worry about it falling off of her in the middle of a cool night, which is great for a little mover like mine. I LOVE that the flat sheet is fitted on the end so that it stays put. Overall it's a good quality product at a great price and I'm very happy with my purchase.
