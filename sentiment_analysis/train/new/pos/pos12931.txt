I used these sets to make impressions of my one-month old baby's hands and feet.  We added a nice picture in the middle, and it made a nice keepsake for our families.  I would totally do it again at another milestone.That said, it took five hours and four people to make these. I'm not even kidding.Hilarious story aside, here are some great tips for making it work well with a small infant:- Roll the clay into the frame about an hour before you plan to press into it.  You can still get one re-do out of it.- Have at leat one other person with you so one person can focus on baby, and one can hold the frame at whatever odd angle you need.- If you are making a lot, consider an extra or practice set.- Do all the foot impressions first.  Baby feet are easier to press into the clay, and you can get a good sense of how hard to push and what the imprints will look like.- It's hard to get baby's hands flat, and keep her from grabbing a handful of clay instead of making an impression.  After a few failed attempts and some replacement clay, we finally got great results with one-hour hardened clay and making the impressions while she was well-distracted with a bottle.- make sure you have the frame the right direction when you make imprints - there is no way to "flip" the frame upside down on one end and not the other.- There are little screws and hinges between the frames.  There is nothing stopping you from taking them apart to put together your best sets.  Multiple sets are really handy for this.- I also wrote baby's name and birthday in the clay.  That worked best once it was dry for maybe 90 minutes.  The included stick was ok, dipped in water between letters.
