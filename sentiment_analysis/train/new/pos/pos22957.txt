I have three kids all of whom were swing babies. With each baby we had two swings - one for the bedside and one for the living room. Needless to say, we have way too much experience with infant swings. After dealing with the crappy engineering of various Fisher Price swings, specifically, Little Snugabunny, Starlight, and Zen Models, I was not going to make the same mistake with my third baby. All three had super loud motor clicking sounds, the metal frames all creaked and could never find a proper balance even on a hard flat surface, and the motors all pooped out after just a couple months. So, we have technology to build particle accelerators and stealth bombers but making an affordable plastic swing that has one main function is too much to ask. I read that the new models inexplicably have auto shut off features which, to me, is confirmation that the R & D folks are all either male and childless or just plain sadistic because what kind of monster creates a machine to sooth a cantankerous baby by is rhythmic motion and sound and then suddenly shuts off at 3am thereby waking the beast and causing mommy to inch one step closer to wrist restraints and confiscated shoelaces? I digress... This swing is far and away the best of the bunch and actually does what it advertises. This thing is a beast and has even survived my 3 year old trying to swing from it. It is quiet, never gets out of balance, and has good speed variability. The pad is easily removable for the many times that your baby will have a diaper blowout or puke or both. Worth. Every. Penny.
