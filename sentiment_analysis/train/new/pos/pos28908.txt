It looks great even after my 15 month old has jumped on it.  It wipes off easily.  The drawer is much bigger than you would think from looking at the picture.The only problem I had was that the original handles were nearly impossible for her to grab.  They also are not drilled to a standard drawer size (the distance between the two holes).  So when I attempted to replace them with something more manageable I couldn't find handles that would fit.  My solution was to put 2 large knobs next to each other instead of each handle.  It was easy to unscrew the original handles.  It gives her something to hold on to.  Not perfect, but it works.If that were changed it would have been a 5 star!
