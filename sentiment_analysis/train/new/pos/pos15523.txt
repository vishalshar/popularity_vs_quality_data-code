Great add-on to our car for the kids. Its sticking nicely to the window. Only issue is, its doesn't fully flatten out. Middle of one-of-the longer edge is bent outward. Hence this small portion is not stuck to the window. Otherwise works fine. Hope it flattens out after few days.Update May 2015: After some sunshine in April, bent have straightened. It now sits nicely on the windows.
