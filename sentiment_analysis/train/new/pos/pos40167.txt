Nice and durable.  I find that I don't use the pockets in front and wonder if anyone does.  I have the back folded down because the car seat is rear facing.  Initially I wanted it up as a protecter from my daughters shoes but the slight thickness made a big difference in my ability to install the seat (Britax Marathon Click Tight).  I just folded it down and was able to install after that.  I don't know if this will be the case when I turn the seat forward facing or not...haven't tried yet.  The width of the base also interferes slightly with the seatbelt buckles.  I actually wish the base of the cover went all the way across the backseat to protect them from the frequent tossing of the sippy cup that sometimes leaks!!
