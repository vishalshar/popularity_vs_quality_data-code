I got this cup because I didn't want to have to bring the whole container of puffs around with us (our diaper bag is already full as it is). It's easy to open and close but it also closed just fine and stayed closed in the diaper bag; I had no issues with it opening up and spilling all over. However, other people did mention that if it's dropped, it will open - this is true. I left it on the table and my son knocked it off and the lid opened and everything spilled out. If you plan on letting your kid use this, you might be better off getting one of those snack containers that have a flexible top to it, like the Munchkin snack catcher containers. My son is not at the age where he knows how to get the snacks out on his own so I knew I would really be the one using this and therefore, I was okay getting it. I like the size of it; small and compact and easy to carry around.
