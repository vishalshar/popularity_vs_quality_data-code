bought this for a friend so he could have a diaper bag that he would be more willing to carry around. i would be happier if this was made of a high denier cordura like most military gear, then it would be definitely worth the money. however 70 dollars seems to be a bit much for it. i believe it will still stand up to some abuse, but for what i payed i was expecting to see higher quality stitching.your kind of stuck paying the high price because it is a unique product. i would personally value it at $40-50.
