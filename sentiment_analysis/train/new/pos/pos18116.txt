My wife and I have twins, so getting something like this was high on our list of priorities as soon as the kids could walk.  We only used it for about a year, but people at malls and other public places always thought it was just so cute.  Several people asked us how to buy one.As far as child leashes go, this one's a winner.  However, child leashes as a whole are not everything parents hope for.  They do nothing really to control which direction your kid goes.  Also, if your kid really objects, he or she will she plump down on the floor screaming -- which draws a lot of unwanted attention.  Since I have two kids, it was some work keeping the leashes from getting tangled.What child leashes do well is to keep wild kids from running off and getting lost or running out into traffic.  With me having two kids, it was sometimes an absolute necessity to use the leashes because the two kids would want to go in two different directions.  I am fast, but I am not fast enough to run after two kids running in two different directions!  =)
