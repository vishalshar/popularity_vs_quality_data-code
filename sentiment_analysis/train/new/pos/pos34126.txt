I found this item to be a great find. I read, researched, and found comparisons between this model, the latest Prince Lionheart model, as well as five of the other popular brands. Since this model is no longer in production, I'm pleased to have found it available on Amazon. I bought two, one for a full sized, currently rear facing car seat, and one for a high back booster seat.Pros:Priceprotection (of leather seating which is why I was looking into seat protectors)ample base seat coverageBonus pouch in the frontNo real bulknonslip backing, which is at least better than the plastic car seat on bare leatherCons:in order to accommodate the full size car seat I had to shift the padding towards the front of the car which moved the seat belt notches forward leaving a tiny part of the car seat base on the exposed leather. (No issues with the booster seat)I slid the seat saver back another inch so the corner of the seat saver was angled instead of flush in the corner. The grip was apparent when trying to slide the seat saver with the full weight of the car seat so I had to remove it before repositioning the seat saver.With both car seats and due to my larger second row seats, a small portion of the pouch is slightly on the seat base, rather than hanging freely.I've found that front or rear facing, the full sized car seat has cushion/padding on the car seat itself that would protect the leather from damage (where it would touch) so having a full back seat saver just wasn't necessary.I did note in other reviews that the backing on some of the seat savers would melt or fuse to the leather or had a bad odor. Neither of those have been the case so far. I'm fortunate to have a car that has tint all around and retractable sunshades so the ambient interior temperatures aren't too bad. I lift the seat savers daily to check and so far I haven't detected anything that would raise a flag.
