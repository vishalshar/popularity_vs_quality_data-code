This bouncer definitely cradles the baby and better than the Papasan. My daughter is 5 weeks old and I have used it for weeks with her. The only problems is the headreast only holds her head too far forward, it doesn't support her head. I actually use it to place under her bottom because the seat sinks in a lot for a baby her size, so placing the headrest under her helps her not sink so far down and kink her neck too far forward. Other than that I love the bouncer and my daughter naps in it and is very comfortable. And it is really cute. I did have the same problem as a previous reviewer with the covers to the rubber foot support spinning.
