I had one of the most commonly used nursing pillow with my first, and while it did the job, after a few months it started going totally flat and I also was having trouble with keeping my baby from falling in the gap between my stomach and the pillow--not so with the Luna Lullaby!Pros:~The "L" shape is so much more comfortable than the typical "U."  I had a c-section and I couldn't imagine having to put a tighter pillow right around my sore incision.  Plus, when other members of the family want to hold the baby (not all of them are small waisted people)everyone can use this pillow comfortably.~It is large enough to be able to comfortably support a variety of nursing positions, even with an older, bigger baby~The covers are easy to slip on and off without needing the jaws of life like on some other nursing pillows--very important during 3AM "eruptions"...~It doesn't scream "NURSING PILLOW" if I leave it out on the couch and we have company over.~The fabric is so so soft on both my skin and my baby's- the dots are raised so there is an interesting tactile facet to this pillow.~It is a versatile pillow-  I can see using it just for myself for naps or watching movies on the couch!Cons:~It is a very large nursing pillow, so it might not fit well if you are nursing in a regular sized wooden-frame glider.  I use it on a la-z-boy recliner, and it is just perfect.~Also related to its' size, it's not exactly travel friendly.  Then again, most of the time I just plan on using it at home, so it wasn't an issue for me.~It is on the pricier sideNeutral:~This is one of the softer nursing pillows I've encountered, which you may or may not like
