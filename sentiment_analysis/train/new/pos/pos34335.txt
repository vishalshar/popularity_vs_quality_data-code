These are just the right size, VERY CUTE and are TOTALLY ADJUSTABLE! I am VERY picky and must have moved one of the monkeys at least 15 times and you can't tell!  They do not even peel freshly painted wall paint off (I couldn't wait, I put them up about 4 or 5 hours after I finished painting--but maybe I was lucky)!  You do have to be careful, they can be a bit awkward and get twisted up and stuck to themselves...would be nice to have a helper on this project. Also, Be careful you don't tear them when you move them around.  Oh, yes, and do NOT set the sticky side on paper.  I accidently set one of my palm leaves on the package upc sticker and it stuck fast...I tried to scrape it off the best I could and the leaf still hung well.I am a designer, and it is not often that I am TOTALLY satisfied with a product, so when I am, I actually take the time to write a review like this.  I honestly can't think of one thing I would change...and that's rare for me...maybe more flowers and grass? I trimmed a few leaves to make stems and used the one plain green leaf to make leaves for the flowers.  I did notice the very slight color difference between trunk pieces, but it is not noticeable AT ALL and I usually stress over such things.  I wish I knew how to do a video review so I could show everyone the finished product...My kids were thrilled when they saw their new bathroom...They played around with the stickers without damaging them...FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, HANG OUT OF REACH TO AVOID CHOKING HAZARD!
