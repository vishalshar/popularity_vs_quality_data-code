The video quality and sound are great. Weather in daylight or night vision, you get a clear picture. You can zoom in from the receiver, play music, or talk to them. The video goes on power safe mode when there is no sound or sudden movements. This prevents u from hearing the white noise all night. The reciever beeps when ur baby starts to move and make noise.It has worked as far as from the second story to my backyard. It's extremely easy to set up. Just plug them in. They come with rechargeable batteries and a docking station. The reciever has a clip for ur pants which converts to a stand.I recommend this item.
