Worth what you pay for it, but not more than that. The bibs are cute, a little small, waterproof, machine-washable, smell a bit like pool toys, and have cute little graphics and the words for each of the days of the week and each of the meals of the day on the terrycloth portion of the bib. The stitching isn't great; the terry's coming loose from the bias tape on two of them after a few washings, and the strings are a bit less tightly stitched together than they were. But overall, I like 'em -- they're what I wanted (waterproof bibs that tie in the back).
