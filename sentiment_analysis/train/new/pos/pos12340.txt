This is working great for us at keeping our 15 month old out of the kitchen cabinets. We have one single cabinet without a door next to it, so that one is "his" cabinet. The others we all have locked with these. At first he tried to pull at them and get them off, but they held tight. Now he just knows they won't open, so leaves them alone. They were a little tricky at first in learning how to open...parent-proof as well as child-proof. But once you get the hang of it, it's really quite easy. These are the best solution to cabinets with knob handles.
