What a wonderful bag at such a great cost. It's not to big or small. I can easily store 3 changes of clothing, Ziploc bag with 6 diapers and small case of huggies wipes, powder, toys. There are two pockets inside for storing my wallet, his thermometer etc. The exterior zipper pocket ideal for keys. two large bottle pockets outside i fit two small neck bottles on one side easily. Its zips close easily even when i stuff it and doesn't feel heavy. the straps are sturdy and comfortable. Made of durable material. I definitely recommend.
