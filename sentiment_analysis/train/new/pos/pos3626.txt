As a new mom I was really worried about clipping the nails, but when the wee one started scratching her face I had to face my fear.  When she sleeps we snip really long nails (be super careful to not cute too short near skin as the nails seem to take awhile to separate from the skin.)  We then use a baby nail file that we purchased at a local store.  We also were gifted an electric baby nail file.  My husband loves it, while I am not as adept with this file.  We are surprised at how often we need to clip the little ones nails, but we are happy to report there have been no cuts or blood in the process (gross, but that is exactly what we were worried about). Great product.
