I purchased several of these Goodbyn bottles for my children since I needed a narrow drink bottle to fit inside their lunch boxes.  We use the bottle with the Goodbyn Bynto (it can even fit inside the Bynto compartment) as well as other bento lunch boxes such as Yumbox and Bentgo Kids (see photos).  So far, we have had no leaks, which is amazing for a bottle without a rubber gasket or screw-top cap; you simply press the lid closed on the spout.  We have packed water and lemonade in these bottles, and the liquids have stayed nicely contained both to and from school.If you have a bento container that fills up most of the space in your child's lunch box, then this narrow bottle might fit nicely in the remaining space.  It measures approximately 1 5/8" wide on the narrow side, about 2 1/8" wide on the larger side (plus the flexible loop on the cap), and around 5 3/8" tall.  The bottle has a #5 printed on the bottom of the plastic.
