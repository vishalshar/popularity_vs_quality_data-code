I use this as a face wash for my adult sensitive skin and it works wonders! I try to convince everyone to use it when I get the opportunity! It totally dissolves all my makeup, even eye makeup. And the tea tree really helps keep my occasional breakouts under control. I've been using it as my face wash for a couple years now.
