At first, I ordered this just because it was so cute. It took awhile to arrive so I recommend ordering it earlier than you plan to use it if possible (it took about 6 weeks for delivery). It arrived shortly after my daughter was born & we laughed that there must have been some sleep-inducing additive in the fabric- our very active, awake newborn, instantly slept when we put her on this. It was her napping spot for months. Now she is over a year old & it is in her crib, as soon as she lays down on it, she curls up & goes to sleep. It is so soft, very well-made & has now been washed/dried over & over with no visible wear or tear. Each time I pull it out of the dryer, it looks new again. I've read other reviews that said they only drip dry theirs but I've had no issue with drying. No shrinkage, no matting of the plush parts. Also, we have the lamb & even with it being the light color (almost white), it still shows no dirt after washing. Absolutely my favorite baby product- and largely because it's still being used daily after the 1st year. Highly recommend this as a gift or for yourself. Any baby or even toddler would enjoy it!
