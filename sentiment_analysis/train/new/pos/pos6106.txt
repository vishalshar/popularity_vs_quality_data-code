We took this stroller on a family trip to Washington DC.  It did great on the "Mall" and through the Capitol Tour.  No problems taking the DC Metro and it folded up really quick!  My only criticism is the strap system.  The straps were somewhat easy to tangle.  Otherwise I thought this was a nice middle cost, lightweight, reclining stroller!
