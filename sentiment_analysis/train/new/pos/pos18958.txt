Really like these, they wash well (warm water, heavy wash) and catch poop like a dream. I use them in an assortment of snap covers and they fit in all. Started using then when my baby was 2mos, he's now 5mo, and the gather makes them a bit shorter than flat inserts which I think fits better in smaller dipes. I use them during the day and use disposable at night (he hates feeling wet, which cloth diapers tend to feel since they don't have moisture wicking chemicals in them). He's very comfortable in them during the day.
