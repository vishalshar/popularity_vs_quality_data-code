I love these bottles for their ability to keep out air. When you put them at an angle to feed, any air follows the hollow tube towards the bottom so that it doesn't get in the liquid and cause bubbles. For babies who suffer from gas, I'd highly recommend! I would suggest buying the bigger size because eventually, most babies will drink more than 4 ounces at each feeding (though not always). The only problem I have with these is the cleaning! You have to clean the bottle, the cap, the nipple, the lid (if dirty), the hollow tube, and a portion that connects to the tube. Cleaning all of these you need 3 brushes (bottle brush, nipple brush, and a miniature brush to get in the small holes). They are a very good bottle, and if your baby needs something like this, it's worth it. Otherwise, aim for a bottle with less cleaning.
