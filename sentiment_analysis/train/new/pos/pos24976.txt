Gorgeous and simple. Perfect for a little baby girl. I've given one to both of my God Daughters at their Baptisms. Hoping to start a family tradition, I'll be ordering a blue one in a few months for our next addition, and his too will be brought to church to be blessed alongside our family during his Baptismal ceremony.A little extra info on the product itself, since I've had 2 now, for those like me, who'd like as much info as possible when ordering online: The little porcelain case each rosary sits in is slightly different each time, and does not close tightly. It is meant to just sit on top, so it will not "secure" the rosary. The pieces will come in a small box, perfect for wrapping or putting into a tiny bag (gift idea...I usually add a crib ornament with this and it's a complete gift for any newborns' baptism). The inside is wrapped in small bubble wrap, so it is packaged and shipped very nicely. There is a little pink pillow, blue for boy, and then the little rosary. It is literally sent to you ready to be wrapped up, or hand delivered as is. I hope this helps. Th trees really nothing else to mention about this product. Feel free to ask.
