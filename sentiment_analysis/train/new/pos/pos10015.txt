I purchased this when they were on sale to try them out. I like them, they feel nice and didn't take much to prep and hold a lot of liquid. I only gave it 4 stars because of the size. I got the 2's for my 18mo and they're pretty bulky and getting a good fit is still difficult. My baby isn't very chunky, if he was I think it would be easier to get a good leg fit. I usually use these after his regular BMs so I don't have to worry about poop getting everywhere. Overall they're a good buy.
