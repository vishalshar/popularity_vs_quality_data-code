Do yourself a favor: stop reading the review and click the add to cart button.  If you are a Prime member (and not much of a procrastinator,) in two days, you'll be glad you did.  I have 6 kids and every birthday is the same; in lieu of a party with friends over, they want a stuffie from Build-a-bear workshop.  Except my boys.  My boys would be mortified with a build-a-bear, (though they have several super hero and Toy Story themed ones).  No, they prefer build-a-dino from T-rex.  These things are heavy and either the chain or the hammock are well suited to hold these.  You could space them out evenly in the hammock, theater seating/audience style, but when I clean, I just throw them up there (but don't tell my kids I do that).  The chain can be hung from the ceiling vertically or horizontally along the wall, which is what I opted for.  I even hung them with the hooks and slant nails for hanging pictures and they have held up really well.  I originally ordered two of these sets hoping that I wouldn't be too disappointed.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  These work great and I will be ordering more. To give you an idea, the hammock alone will hold almost a thirty gallon trash bags' worth of these stuffies, provided you don't mind just chucking them up there to clear up floor space.
