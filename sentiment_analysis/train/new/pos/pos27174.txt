I've had 5 different monitors.  This one has by far the least background static.  It is the only one I can sleep with because I am a picky sleeper.We did have the occasional loud bursts of static that other reviewers have mentioned but we luckily discovered it was coming from our 900mhz digital cordless phone talking to its cradle.  We had to unplug the cradle and remove the battery from the phone every nite before bed which was a hassle but worth it for the quiet sleep.  We've now replaced the home phone for a different reason and the current one does not interfere with the monitor at all.  I think this unit is very sensitive around various phones and if you cannot get clear reception it may be too close to a neighbor's phone even.If you can get it to work in your environment, it is by far the best option for a monitor.  Buy it from a place that gives refunds and give it a try.My only complaint is I dont see why both units are not rechargable.  My baby doesnt sleep in the same place all the time and it would be nice to be able to move the base unit around as well.  I dont really understand why they wouldnt both take the same type batteries.  It gets confusing.  At least the power cords are interchangeable.  It would be nice to go visit Grandma for the afternoon and not bring the cord with me.Also our first unit had to be exchanged because the battery connections were poor resulting in "out of range" and powering off, but the replacement has worked wonderfully for several years.
