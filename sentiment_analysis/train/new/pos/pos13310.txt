This is a tiny toy. Do not buy if you think it is big in comparison to the toddler model. The seller, however, is a perfect example of the kind of store we used to see in the old days - you should buy all your toys from this seller. I made a somewhat negative review of this item back in December, and although I explained to the vendor via email that I was satisfied, they still sent me a refund check (which I will not be cashing). You can trust this vendor to take good care of you during and after the sale.
