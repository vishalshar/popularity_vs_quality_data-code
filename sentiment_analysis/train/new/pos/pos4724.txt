This isn't my favorite. I have a one year old who just wants cheerios when she's in the stroller and out of sight, out of mind. She can't even see in this, even when she pulls as far forward as she can. Maybe it's a good insulator for bigger kid stuff, so maybe someday I'll appreciate it more. Right now she holds her sippy cups in her lap, so it's more or less useless for me.EDIT: I gave this another star. Now that my daughter is 1.5 this is more useful. (I stated this might be the case in the original review.) She's big enough to put her cup in the insulated container when she's not drinking, and sometimes I put a cup of fruit in the other side as well. It's nice that it can easily be wiped out and is insulated. It did not work well with a smaller baby who's view was obstructed by it. She can easily see over it now, so it's not a problem.
