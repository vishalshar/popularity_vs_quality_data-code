It's cute, I wish I would have remember another review I read before purchasing that said when they washed it it ruined the mirror, but I didn't. I washed it a few times and it was fine, but I washed it again and this time threw it in the dryer and ruined the mirror. Oops oh well my son still likes it. Next time ill know not to throw them in the dryer. It's also pretty flat. I didn't realize that when I bought it, but still cute.
