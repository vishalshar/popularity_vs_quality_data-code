Baby refused the bottle starting at 3 months of age, no matter what was in it. A few months later we found this cup and she has been using it ever since. We use it for breast milk, water, formula, dried goat's milk, regular whole milk, and even strained chicken soup. She loves holding the handles and controlling the flow herself. We bought the 10oz learner cup for bigger nighttime feedings, for which you can use the exact same nipples as the 5oz.I recommend buying 2 days worth so if you don't have time or energy to wash them one day, you can do it every 2 days. I throw the cups in the dishwasher and then give them an extra rinse when they're done (to make sure no dishwasher detergent is on them).The inchbug labels fit perfectly around them.Also, NUK has great customer service. Called when we accidentally fried the nipples (LOL!) because water was low in the pot.
