We received this for a Christmas present. My son continues to love this toy. He now stands up to play it. I would recommend this toy with one important warning. The center globe has a flap or page that his likes to turn. It switches from one mode to another with this turning. Unfortunately, the globe is not perfectly round so that when it is right in the middle, there is an opening and my baby's fingers get caught in it. A few times, he cried and I was able to see it and take it out. The last time he got his finger more severely stuck in it and then fell down contorting his finger in it further.  I ran to him by then he was screaming (I was just about 10 ft away); the end of his finger was purple from lack of circulation. It took 10 minutes to calm him, he refused ice so I stuck it in snow while he still cried.Solution-I was able to remove the flap. Now, he just has that one mode which he still enjoys. He laughs at the duck and bard sounds.I am online to write to Baby Einstein and tell them of these incidents. I think they and you should know.
