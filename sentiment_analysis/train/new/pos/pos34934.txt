The Bubbly Hippo is very cute, but does not fit standard shower faucets. It's also very short and the opening to slide the faucet into is very small. Very disappointed it didn't work out. I attached a picture showing my type of shower faucet. Hopefully it will help others who are questioning if it will fit theirs.
