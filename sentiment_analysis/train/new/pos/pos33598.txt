This toy box is a winner.  It's so colorful and Mickey just makes you smile.1.  It's soft yet sturdy.  The top of the toy box is soft and cushioned, perfect when our little one uses it to sit on.  It's suitable for sitting.  The wood it is made of appears to be particle board.  Upon opening the toy box you see the wood and it's unfinished, but smooth so no splinters.  It can handle having heavy toys dropped in it; still no scratches or dings (and we've had this for over a year).2.  The safety hinges work just like they should.  Our son opens and closes the toy box on his own.  He keeps it open as long as he needs to and when it is time to clean up he closes it.  No pinched fingers!3.  It is easy to keep clean.  The toy box has had juice spilled on it, sticky fingers all over it and I've used a barely moist cloth.  If I've missed anything I can't tell, I don't see any stains.4.  This item can hold a decent amount of toys.We liked this item so much we bought the matching rocker chair (they didn't have it on Amazon we bought it from Babies R Us).  This item is also made in the USA!
