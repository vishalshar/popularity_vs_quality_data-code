I am a visiting nurse and have used this thermometer for three years now. When I opened the package it looked a little flimsy to me (I replaced an Exergen with it) but this has lasted longer than the Exergen did (full disclosure: I wiped the head of the Exergen, which required forehead contact, with alcohol after every use and the instructions tell you not to do that). A few months ago it stopped beeping, there is a rattle inside it and the screen had a few dark spots on it that I thought might be indicative of the end of its life so I purchased a Zigabob non-contact infrared thermometer. The Zigabob gives crazy high temps (as high as 103 in warm rooms) that turn out to be false when checked with an oral thermometer so I am in the market for another one of these. The one I have has been used several times per day, five days per week for three years, that says something.  Because contamination is a concern in all health care settings I love that I can get accurate temps on my patients with no concern about spreading germs from one person to the next. (It has also proved handy with people with dementia -- I can get a temp without needing their cooperation as I do for BPs.)
