These are my 2 and 5 years olds favorite cups, when not using just a regular adult cup.  They are very easy to clean, easy to pop up the straw, and are leak proof.  We use them for any and all travel because we know we don't have to worry about them leaking in the bag.  I do wish they made an insulated version, however.  *hint *hint to thermos!
