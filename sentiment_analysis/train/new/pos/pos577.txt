Using to pad a hand brace around the thumb.  The adhesive is not very strong and kept popping off, so I added tiny squares of black Gorilla tape (the 30 lb. type) and now it holds well.  Before getting the 30 lb. tape I had tried 15 lb. Gorilla tape from the craft store, but it wouldn't hold.  Now I have very good cushioning to keep my braces from digging into my skin..
