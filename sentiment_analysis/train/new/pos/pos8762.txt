My husband and I originally picked this combo out in the store but purchased here because it was a lot more budget friendly. It is of good quality and works well for our son. The only negative would be is the car seat is kind of small.  My son is a little big for his age, 14lbs at 11 weeks and he looks like he's filling it out already. I hate that we will have to purchase another car seat soon but am happy that he will be able to use the stroller into toddlerhood.
