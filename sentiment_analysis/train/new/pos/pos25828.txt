THIS TUB IS AWESOME!!  After purchasing a high dollar sink bathtub and a few others for the regular bathtub, not to mention a few toy dives, face-first, by my 7 month old who's just learned how to sit up OUTSIDE of the tub, I was desperate for something better so we could safely enjoy bath time.  This really did the trick!  I'm only sad I didn't find it sooner because I think it would've been perfect for when he was tinier as well.  Both sides of the tub are very comfortable for him!  I did purchase one of those terry-cloth shell shaped bath pillows to stick along the back on the side that he sits up in just because he is on the smaller side still - it's a perfect set up, so thank you to the reviewer who suggested this.  I will definitely be purchasing this as a gift for any future baby showers!  Love it!
