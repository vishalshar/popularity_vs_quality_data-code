My wife and I decided to buy one of these "portable toilets" after our fully potty trained 4-year-old put the whole family through one of our most shameful and traumatic experiences lately (a piece of advice: if you go to outdoors playgrounds without toilet, bring one of these).To the point: this travel potty is a wonderful product. I normally make a "good" and "bad" list, but I can only find good points for this potty:- The potty is made of hard plastic, and it feels sturdy. The finishing is really good- When closed, the potty takes really little space and can be easily kept in the trunk- It takes only a couple of seconds to open it (check the video).- Once open, the legs lock in place, making it very sturdy and stable- You can use any 1-gallon bag. The manufacturer had the decency to include a few bags, so we can start using it straight away- There are two side pockets. One holds the empty bags. The other side is intended to hold the "final goods" after using the potty, if you do not have a trash around- Once finished, it takes just a few seconds to close it- It is very easy to carry it thanks to the side handleIt gets a little tricky to find the place to push to close the toilet, or to open the side compartments. To close the toilet, you need to find the "Push" flap, which is in the inner side of the legs (I show it in the video). To open the side compartments, you will need to press hard on the green cover, next to the lock, until it opens. I do appreciate that the lock is somehow hard, since I do not want this to open by accident.Overall, this potty is totally worth the money for two reasons. First, because it is a very functional, well-built product. And second, because it buys peace of mind for future outings with my son. I fully recommend it!
