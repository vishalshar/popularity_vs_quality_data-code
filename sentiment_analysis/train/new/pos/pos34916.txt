I like this stroller however there are a couple of things that i wish that it had. The good things about it are that the handles are higher up than normal umbrella stroller and are padded. The wheels turn really good and the all weather feature is great. The only problems i have with this stroller are that there are no cupholders. And there is no where to store toys or anything of the sort. Also the rain cover is not very big and therefore if out in the rain the child gets wet. I would recomment this stroller if going out on a sunny day!
