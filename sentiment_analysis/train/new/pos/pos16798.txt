My son was going through a biting stage and daycare suggested one of the teething necklaces.  I didn't want him walking around with one of the necklaces on, but this did the trick.  It fit his wrist, he liked it and it was something he could go to if his teeth were bothering him (he had multiple coming in at the same time).It's a little expensive for what it is, but it worked for us.
