Our 6 month old likes but doesn't love this jumper.  She uses it in the bathroom door while I shower in the mornings.  Sometimes she goes wild jumping, but not all that often, which is fine for the time of day.  She likes the activity bar that attaches to the tray.  In fact, if your baby doesn't seem to be getting the hang of jumping, try taking it off for a few days. When our baby first started using it, she'd just lean back and spin around while playing with the buttons like she was controlling a spaceship.  She didn't realize she could jump and by leaning back to have a good view of the toy, she wasn't positioned for jumping.  She learned to jump right away when I took the toy off, and once she got that she will now jump with it on.  It's easy to take on and off the door frame every day.  It's a little tough to adjust the height, but that is probably so it doesn't slip while in use.There seems to be confusion about whether the toy comes off - it does.  It attaches to the tray with a Velcro strap.  The package even recommends taking it off to use on the floor as a tummy time toy (not good for this because the baby will just tip it over).
