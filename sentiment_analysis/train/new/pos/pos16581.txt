I was happy to find this collection after being so sick of finding tons of teddy bear, train and monkey themed collections that are just blah. I bought the coordinating crib sheet (2 of them), window valance, wall sticker decals, set of three canvas prints and plush fleece blanket from this Jill McDonald Adorable Dinos collection. Since this is my third child, I've learned the uselessness of a crib comforter, traditional bumper and skirt/dust ruffle- so I chose not to order the bedding set. This mobile is perfect, however! I'm not sure if other reviewers just received a defective mobile or not- but this music lasts quite a while and the little dinosaurs DO rotate slowly on their own to stimulate baby and soothe them. So far, the quality of all the items I ordered from this collection have been true to description, worth the price and the perfect answer to the oh-so common monkeys and teddy bear collections.
