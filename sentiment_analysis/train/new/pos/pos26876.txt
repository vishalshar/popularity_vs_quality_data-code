I purchased these diapers to make burp rags out of to give as gifts. I just sew a strip of flannel down the center "panel." I used to use the cheap Gerber prefolds but they are such a mess it was so frustrating. The center panel was never consistent across all the diapers, the lines were so crooked it was impossible to get it to look nice plus the material was gauzy and would snag on the presser foot, it was just a nightmare. I decided to look for real cloth diapers to use. I figured that since they came in sizes, and had to fit a specific diaper type they would be more consistent in dimensions. I landed on these and they pretty much fit the bill. The center panel isn't exactly the same on all of them, but it's close enough that I dont have to alter my measurements, and can just cut everything the same and it will work. I cut a strip of fabric that's 13"x4.5" and have a .5" hem all the way around. The quality of the material is FAR above the Gerber material, it soft and thick and not snaggy at all. The color of the material in the image is white but the color I received is off white/natural.  I gave this a 5* based on the fact that it's exactly as described (expect for the color which is minor) and the fact that it's perfect for it's actual designed use. If I were basing my rating on what I am using it for I would rate it 4.5* just because of the minor inconsistencies.
