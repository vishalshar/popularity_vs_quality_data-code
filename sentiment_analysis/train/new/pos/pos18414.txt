I ordered 2 of these toy boxes, one in the blue mod and the other in pink. I was expecting them to be a little bigger based on the other reviews. I should have gone by the dimensions listed but since other reviewers stated it was much bigger than what they expecting, I guess I pictured something larger in my mind. My own fault. I like that it is soft and can be easily folded up and moved if needed. I love that the flap is soft so if one of my kids is in the toy box looking for something, I'm not worried about the lid hitting their head. I got the 2 toy boxes to put in the living room so the kid's toys aren't scattered about. My husband really doesn't like the colors since they don't match the furniture and prefers them to be hidden behind the sofa. I was going to get a 3rd one to hold the rest of the games but we have no more room behind the sofa so I'm still looking for something similar but that can be put in the open.These would be even better if they were offered in solid netural colors with maybe just a trim of color. If you don't mind the bright colors, then these are great and definitely worth a second look.
