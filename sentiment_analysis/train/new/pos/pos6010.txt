Arrived on time. The seat looks good. The only thing is, it's a bit small for our toddler, who is taller than normal tough, so his head rests at the canopy and when i need to use it he has to get lower which forces him to sit in not the best way for his spine. This also limits storage space a lot especially now in winter when using footmuff. In the summer we used the second seat for our yonger one and kept swapping them but my son loves to be down so there is nothing we can do :). As for the storage space, u can still access it using side and front zippers,it's just not as smooth as with one seat or when we had basinet-top seat version (the adapter for basinet moved the top seat which we used as a second seat futher away and thus the storage basket was easy to access. Still this is the best possible version of the stroller for two kids - very functional and stylish and we got always many compliments on it. One other thing related to this version is that the Britax is not producing rain covers for this version and u can't find in any retailers. When i asked them what solution they have for that the rep told me that they no longer produce the item. LOL and outrageous at the same time as they limit my schedule to weather forecast. Ridiculous and disappointing.
