These do the job just fine, and I like them especially for times when you will be moving around a lot & your nursing bra might shift (like at nighttime). They are very easy to reposition as needed with little fussing or thought. However, when going out-and-about it is worth noting that they do create quite the bump silhouette under your clothes, so ought to be worn with a very thick bra or clothing is you don't want the hump to show.
