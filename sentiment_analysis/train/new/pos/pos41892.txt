I purchased both the Clownfish & Ducks design.  My STANDARD sized bath tub needed BOTH packs, as one wouldn't of provided sufficient coverage.  I found the quality of the design and sticking power to be beyond my expectations.  As long as you prep the surface before application as suggested, you won't have a problem. Some of the cleaners leave a residue, so maybe that's where some folks have issues with the treads sticking.  After scrubbing the tub squeaky clean, I found that you'd best lay out the designs ahead of time.  The last decal stuck where I didn't want it to and it was a struggle to remove it and place where it belonged.  It was that last Duck that did it!  So, I'm happy with the adhesive used. Also, not a consideration by some, but I'm happy that soap, dirt, etc...doesn't stick in between the decals, like a prior set.  Only reason I have searched this product mostly in stores until now, is that I had to turn my bathroom into a handicapped friendly environment.  My 85 year old mother needs assistance when bathing and these treads turned out to be not only functional, but the Clownfish and Duck designs are fun for all, at any age! The texture and color are good quality also.  Prior to this brand, I had a shell design from another company.  The texture was too rough.  Those did a good job of non slip, but it tended to irritate sensitive feet, over time.  That's when I replaced those, with this brand.  Their gripping power is just right and not irritating to the elderly, or diabetic neuropathy feet, if that's any consideration.  Get creative with 2 packs/designs for arranging the alternating patterns in your tub!
