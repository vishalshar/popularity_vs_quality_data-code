I love this storage rack - I am a total neat freak and it would drive me insane if I had milk bags toppling all over my freezer. I have two of these side by side in my freezer and it's like a little breastmilk assembly line, popping out the oldest milk on one end for use and dropping the new stuff in the other for later - awesome!As others have said, it is important to freeze the bags flat first and then drop them in. I use the Nuk brand bags and obviously they are the perfect size since they were designed for each other. However, it sounds like this works well with other brands as well based on other reviews. I will add that I love these bags, I've been pumping and freezing for 6 months without a single one breaking.I wanted to point out for those who have had trouble with their bags freezing in a wedge shape even when they lie them flat to freeze- mine do that too to some degree, but this does not create a problem at all if you just alternate the direction that you stack them!I freeze between 5 and 8 ounces in each bag and they stack perfectly when I alternate the direction. My racks have 10 bags in them each right now, no problem! Actually as you can see from the picture I really should get a third rack but am making do by stacking the rest in a little tower that's supported by these racks and it's working well enough for now.Overall a great product, I highly recommend if you want your milk to stay organized in your freezer!
