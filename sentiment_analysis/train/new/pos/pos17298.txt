I needed a basic stainless steel bottle and this one really works for us. However I wish there were latex nipples available to fit it since we avoid plastic whenever possible (and silicone... not to be confused with the element silicon... is plastic, no matter what they call it). In my search for latex I tried a few brands of nipples other than the ones listed as compatible on the Pura website and indeed none of them fit. It supposedly came with slow flow nipples but I found them too fast for my baby (and much faster than the other slow flow bottles we had) so I bought another brand of compatible slow flow nipple which worked fine.The ounce markings in the bottle aren't helpful. Unless you have a flashlight and a periscope you can't actually look into the bottle and read the markings. I don't need this feature anyway but if you want to easily be able to tell how much is in the bottle you're going to want to go with glass (or plastic).
