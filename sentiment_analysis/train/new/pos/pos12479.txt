I had this bib for my 2 older kids and looooved it. It is missing, so I ordered a new one for the baby.Pros: It is super lightweight, so it is easy to pack and dries quickly. I love how long it is. Really covers the entire outfit. We used it on the airplane until my other daughter was 4! We always seem to be spilling things on the plane and I loved that we didn't arrive looking nasty.Cons: I bought this for my very petite 8 month old and the neck is too large. Because of the velcro placement, I can't tighten enough to keep there from being a huge gap where things spill down her chest. But she will grow, so I will hold on to the bib for when she is a little bigger!
