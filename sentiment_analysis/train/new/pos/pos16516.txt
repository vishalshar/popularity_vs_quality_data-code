I purchased this swing for my grandson (5 1/2 months) when he visits from out of town.  Have used it a couple weeks and the batteries are still good.  He LOVED batting around the toys that make sounds on the tray.  I even took them off for him to play with when he wasn't in the swing.  Had to put it on a 'high' speed to get decent rocking action, but didn't seem to be a problem.  Very happy with it and hope it lasts through more grandchildren!
