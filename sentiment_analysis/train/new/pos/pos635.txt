This product is a two pack of boy and girl Hasbro Playskool Weebles in matching pink and blue pajamas. They were created as a compliment to the Christmas 2011 Weeble House Set. Like all Weebles products they should entertain a one year old or toddler well enough, but keep in mind that this set was only on sale for the 2011 year and as such was discontinued after Christmas 2011 along with all the newer Hasbro Playskool Weeble toys. I hope this does not discourage Hasbro Playskool from restarting the line sometime in the future because they are really cute, especially when you have a collection of all sorts of little Weeble people.
