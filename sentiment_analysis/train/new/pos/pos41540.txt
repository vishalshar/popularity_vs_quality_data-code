Keeps the back of the seat clean from mud, dirt, snow, slush, etc since my 2yr old and 4yr old don't ever keep their dirty shoes down. I like all the pockets and storage. The only thing I really needs to be improved is the way is secures to the seat at the bottom of the organizer. I have an 08 suburban and the little elastic bands with tiny hooks don't have anything to secure or clip to. So it just hangs there instead of being snug to the back of the seat. It's a little annoying. Overall, the price is fair and does the job.
