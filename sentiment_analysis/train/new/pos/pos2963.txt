I shopped around to find this crib. it was the least expensive 3 in 1 convertible WITH a drawer I could find. The drawer is great for storing blankets and sheets. It does slide kind of rough though. Assembly isn't too difficult. My husband and I assembled it together the first time while I was about 8 months pregnant and everytime since then (moving to a new house and changing the height of the mattress) I've done it on my own. There was a recall on the brackets. I ordered new ones from the storkcraft website. It took a couple months but they did eventually come. I installed those alone as well. It is somewhat difficult to attach a mobile because of the way the side of the crib slants. The mobile we had also scratched the finish off the side slats (so be careful). When converting to a toddler bed I think that the mattress is a bit high. It's still a beautiful crib though. I've ordered 3 storkcraft pieces through amazon and never had delays in shipping nor have I recieved any damaged product, as a lot of other people say they have. I would have still bought this crib because the price was right. Also, if you order this from amazon, don't be fooled that it is eligible for free shipping, it is not. It is considered an oversized item and that adds about $50 tothe price. I'm angry that they are still advertising that this is eligible for free shipping almost a year and a half later.
