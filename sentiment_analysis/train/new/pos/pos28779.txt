Beautiful Craftsmanship. Looks great. Arrived Promptly. Great price when compared to similar products from places like Pottery Barn. Definitely order this prduct. Very Pleased.Not 5 stars only because (and this is nitpicking) the screw holes for the wall mounting don't have wood hole covers so the visable screws distract the eye from the otherwise beautiful work. Also the back of it is not stained, has wood stained fingerprints (not at all visable when mounted). 5 stars means perfect to me. Those two things make it almost perfect.
