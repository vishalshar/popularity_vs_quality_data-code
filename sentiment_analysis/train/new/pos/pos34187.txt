LOVE this walker so much! It is very sturdy and doubles as a bumper cart for my son! Compared to others that use cheap plastic this one uses hard plastic which is perfect as my son likes to lean over and ram it into things. its also fairly easy to clean; wipe down the front and throw the seat in the washing machine. Also the different height levels allowed him to use it for a while as he grew. The only thing I wasnt too fond of was the music. I found it a tad loud but every1 else said it was fine. Simple solution, turn it off! Very satisfied with this purchase.
