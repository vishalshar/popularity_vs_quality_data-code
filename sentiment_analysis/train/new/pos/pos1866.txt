I don't know how parents live without this.  My little girl loves bath time.  She will happily spend an hour splashing around.  I love seeing her so happy, but it's a killer on the old knees (and elbows).  I'm so glad I found this mat.It sticks to the inside of the tub with suction cups. The elbow rest is made of cushy foam and the knee pads are even cushier.  There's mesh in the spots where it folds.  It has pockets for storing bath essentials and folds up easily when you don't need to use it (but not when the pockets are full).  To be honest, I don't use the pockets.I've used this for over a year and it's still in perfect condition.  No tears, mold or stains and the cushions are just as cushy as the day we got it.  I'm not sure what the official cleaning strategy is, but I run it through the washing machine with the bath mat about once a month.  I don't machine dry it, but it dries out quickly on it's own.After giving a bath at my house, my mother in law bought one for her home.  Makes grandma duty so much better.This would make a great baby shower gift.  I've never seen it on anyone's registry, but I will recommend (or purchase) it to future moms to be.  It's not glamorous or cute, but it is such a nice thing to have.
