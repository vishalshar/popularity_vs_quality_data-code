I love, LOVE this stacker.  It is a puzzle as well as a stacker and there are many ways that a child can play with it.The wood is awesome quality - heavy solid hardwood (more on that later).  Pieces are stained, not painted, so no worries about chipped paint.  Downside is that because it is stained, the colors are not as vibrant as those in the photos.The puzzle factor of the stacker is a bit difficult for very young toddlers (1-2 yr olds) to figure out.  The product description on amazon says it is for 1+, but the box of the product says it is for 3+, now what 3-yr old is into stacking anymore?  So yes, that's the downside of this stacker.  But my 18-mo old plays with it, and that's the 5-10 min I need here and there.One thing to keep in mind is that the pieces are hardwood and very heavy.  When I first got it, my 1-yo was having trouble with the larger pieces; he could not pick them up with one hand, but he managed using two hands (he is very strong and has good grip and fine motor skills so that helped too).  Now the true downside of the heavy wood is that my 1-yo likes to throw things, so when he threw one of the pieces, I realized that it could cause real damage.  Fortunately it hit the rug or he would have left a dent on our hardwood floors or the coffee table.  But the piece did not crack or break, so I am a happy owner of the stacker.
