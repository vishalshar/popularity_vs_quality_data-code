We did a knights and dragons theme for my son and his room. Finding knights and dragons for most things was virtually impossible so this was a nice discovery.The little plastic ring fits over the handle of the pacifier nice and tight. (not loop through it and over itself like I did the first time. Wife looked at me like I Was crazy.)Material is a kind of linen, but seems durable enough and easy to clean. It is well sewn. The clip is plastic but we have had it for 6 months and not had any issues at all with it.Highly recommended.
