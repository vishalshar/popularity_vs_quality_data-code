Originally we wants to get a high chair, but this turned out to be a VERY GOOD choice!  In fact it's so easy to assemble, we've taken it along with us to long trip when we stayed at friend's place, so we didn't have to hold our LO all the time. This is definitely the right item for us. High recommended.
