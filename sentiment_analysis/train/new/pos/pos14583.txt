I had to get these pig slippers for my daughter because I have a pair of pig slippers she has been obsessed with. These probably aren't the greatest slippers for small children to walk in but they looked the most like mine so wanted them for that reason! I also just thought this was a great price, especially for everything you get! The backpack is darling and we love the bath scrubbers! The slippers fit her ok right now but I would say they are probably sized more like a 7-8 toddler. She is about a 5 right now and they are a little big but my son is a size 9 and they fit him but with not much room in the back! The quality is ok on this whole set but for the price I think they are better than I expected! I definitely recommend these and think the set would make a great present!
