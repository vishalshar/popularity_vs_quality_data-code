After my nephew was delivered at the hospital it was obvious that he really enjoyed snuggling, but also being swaddled. I knew the first time I held him that he would need a Swaddler, especially since my brother and sister in law would probably be too tired in the middle of the night to figure out swaddling. It was delivered right about the time they came home. A night or two later they were having difficulty getting my sweet nephew to sleep and couldn't figure out what was wrong. My brother remembered suddenly that I had advised him to try the swaddler when he was at his wit's end. The instant he got that newborn swaddled, he stopped crying and fell asleep. As my brother said, "Oh my gosh, it was instant shut-up!" They used it constantly until he outgrew it and broke into the two-pack in the next size up.Nephew was born at 10lbs or so, therefore I bought the one that had 10 lbs in the low range but not the smallest size. I also bought the next size up so that he could use them past 12/14 lbs. He's a big boy!
