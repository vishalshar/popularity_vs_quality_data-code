This is exactly the waterproof material I was looking for in a changing pad. And it's really big which is what I'd been looking for. All the other travel changing pads were either cloth material, or very narrow and babies have a tendency to get their hands dirty once they get to a certain age and I didn't want them to be able to reach over and touch anything other than the changing pad! I bought a similar one after this, just a tiny bit smaller and without the pouch, but from the same manufacturer. Couldn't be more ecstatic that I found this! I also love how the actual mat can detach from the pouch.
