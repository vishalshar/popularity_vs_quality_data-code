My 1 year old was waking multiple times a night crying because his pacifier would fall out of his mouth while he was sleeping and he either a) couldn't find it (even though we used glow in the dark pacifiers) or b) it would fall through the slats and be unreachable.  We tried everything including throwing as many as 5 pacifiers into the crib at bedtime hoping he might stop crying and waking us throughout the night. Finally, at his 1 year check up, his pediatrician asked how he was sleeping and I explained our predicament.  She suggested an item like this.  I got online and researched and this one was cute and would allow me to use his favorite pacis by Mam, but would also work with avent ones we have.When it first arrived, I attached a Mam pacifier to it and gave it to him.  He spent a little while trying to get the puppy off of the pacifier, but then gave in and put it in his mouth.  Even though we usually reserve the pacifier for bedtime and naps,  I let him use it for 3 days off and on throughout the day to get it so he would associate the plushy puppy with his pacifier.  A week later, we were sleeping through the night for the first time in a year!!  He is able to find the pacifier more easily and it is less likely to slip through the slats.  It also seems to be a soothing thing for him to hold the pup when he gets upset.  I am ordering a 2nd one as a back up.
