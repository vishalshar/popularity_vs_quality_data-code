My grandfather made me a cradle when I was a child and over the years it has been repainted and decaled several times. I did it for my daughter and then my granddaughters and now my grandson. The surface is very rough but the dino wall stickers are sticking great. The remainder of the stickers are going on his bedroom wall. I would recommend wall decals to anyone. I also purchased the crib bedding set and they match perfectly.
