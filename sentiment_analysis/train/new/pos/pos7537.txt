Great potty seat for any toddler. It fits nice & snug on the toilet seat. It does not pinch her skin and the handles on the side are convenient.  The product description claims it to be unisex. I think the arched "peepee guard" on the front of the seat makes it difficult for a 2yr old girl to get herself over the guard. She cant get herself on the seat and both legs around the guard without first sitting on the guard then readjusting herself . She ends up sitting on the bump, say "ouchie!". Any adult knows that cannot be comfortable for anyone, much less a 2yr/girl. The manufacturer should make the guard detachable (for little girls). The hook to hang the seat on the side of the toilet is nice, but it is too large to fit between the toilent tank and the wall/cabinet when the blue arch back support is attached.
