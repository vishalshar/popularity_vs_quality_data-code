Purchased a new set for our Hygeia pump - I would recommend buying at regular intervals after the birth of your child - we bought after 6 months of use, would recommend purchasing every 3-4 months to get the most out of your pump. As these wear out over time the suction capability will decline and only subtly which can lead to decreased milk production. After replacing, the pump functioned like the first day.
