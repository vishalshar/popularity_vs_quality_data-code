Love these for my teething daughter!! I would freeze breast milk into ice cube trays and then put them in here for my baby to suck on.  This would keep her entertained for quite awhile!  Great for frozen fruit too!  A staple item!  I always include these in any baby shower gift because they were nutrition, pain relief, and entertainment all in one!! And for all the bad reviewers...all you have to do is wash them out after use instead of letting the fruit crust on them in the sink and you won't have any problem! It's really not rocket science.
