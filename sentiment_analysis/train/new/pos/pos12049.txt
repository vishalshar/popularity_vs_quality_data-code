I am a mother of three kids and I absolutely LOVE this bassinet!  We purchased this bassinet off of Amazon (we are a military family, living overseas) and it arrived very quickly and in perfect shape!  We were pleased that we received it within one week of purchase.The bassinet was easy to put together (not too many parts).  I really like the height of it; I do not have to hunch over when changing my baby.  The design and color are rich looking.  We use it in our living room and it fits perfect! (Not too big, not too small).  The wheels are an added plus... it makes it easy to move around.  We use it equally for the changing table and for our baby to sleep.  I filled the baskets with clothes/blankets and one with wipes, diapers, cream, etc.The only downfall for us is that the diaper stacker is flimsy and could have been constructed better.  I highly recommend that the company looks into designing a stronger diaper stacker.  I think it would have held up better with ties instead of the velcro that is on it (the placement of the velcro seems odd to us).Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this bassinet!!  Excellent gift or purchase!
