I have been looking for something to help my almost 3 year old, stubborn little boy to potty training. He is my 4th child and haven't had near the problems with my other 3 then I do with him. I thought this was a unique idea.  First off it was even faster shipping then I ever had. Thank you. Second the product is made of durable plastic kind of like step 2 kid products. So easy to put together pretty much a 3 step process of your not hanging it on the wall (which by the way is an option. My 3 year old loves it. I can't keep him out of the bathroom. The blue tank in the picture you actually fill with water and when they push the top button real water comes out of the top. It definitely helps him wanting to go potty. I just have to say thank you for a great product
