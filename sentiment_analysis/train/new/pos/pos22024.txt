Initially we bought this toy for our 10 month old because it was a favorite at the children's museum. Balls are hits in general. This one stands out though compared to other balls or even other Oballs. The open sides make it easy to grip. But it's the rain stick in the middle that really makes this toy special. It makes a delightful rattling sound when rolling or shaken. It's loud enough to delight the child while quiet enough to not annoy people who dislike noise. As with any rain stick turning this rain stick ball upside down just to watch the beads cascade adds yet another entertaining element. Even our almost 5-year-old enjoys playing with it. Overall the ball is well worth the price. Highly recommend!
