This is a really useful model - especially the ability to recline the seat, it has a vibration mode, and it has pillow inserts so that even newborn heads don't roll around. The only reason not to give it 5 stars, is like all Graco Open Top models for some reason the tray is open underneath so little feet push against the inner lip of the tray and get scratched with no socks or caught. I wish Graco would add a peice to close off/fill in the underneath of the tray.
