I honestly don't know what we'd do without these...Our little guy is four months old and not rolling over yet, so we needed to upgrade to the "small" size, but we've been using the Halo swaddle sacks since he was born. They're SO much easier than swaddling with a traditional swaddle blanket, especially in the middle of the night when you're barely functioning as it is. Little Guy wakes himself like crazy without a swaddle, and these are just plain awesome. They're high quality, stand up to the zillion washes that they've been through, and the velcro is strong. Our little dude has never been able to break out of them.Just for those who aren't aware, though, these do NOT follow traditional baby sizing. The "newborn" size lasted us until he stopped wearing 0-3 in all other outfits, and the small looks as though it will last us quite a bit longer. He's currently in 3-6 in most outfits, and we still have lots of room to grow in the "small" size.
