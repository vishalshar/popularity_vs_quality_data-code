I purchased these at the same time I purchased my Boba so I put them on before I tried the carrier out on my baby for the first time. The second I put him in the carrier he started chewing on these teething pads. If I hadn't put them on he would have been chewing directly on the carrier. The carrier instructions say not to put it directly in the washing machine so I feel much better knowing that he was chewing on the pads (which I washed first in baby detergent). Plus I bought a few extra sets so if he is in the carrier for a long period of time and gets the pads really wet I can easily change them out. I would say these are a must have for your baby carrier while your baby is teething or for babies who just like to chew.
