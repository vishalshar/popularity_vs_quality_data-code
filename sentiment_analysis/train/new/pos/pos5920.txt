We've had this bag 19 months and use it as our main diaper bag. We keep a bigger diaper bag around for major trips -- beach, zoo, etc. -- but this is the bag that goes everywhere with us. I guess we're minimalists. It holds 2-3 diapers, a small wipes pouch, two bottles (Dr. Browns) and a pouch or bag of food or snacks. I've never had a reason to carry three bottles. I also keep individually packaged sunscreen wipes in it. The front pocket will hold a couple credit cards and an iPhone. We rarely need to carry anything else. I own two of these bags (I use the other to hold a Medela Freestyle breast pump) and I've never had a problem with the zipper on either one. I am replacing the main bag after 19 months of heavy use because after another bottle spill it's gotten stinky. All previous spills have cleaned up fine by washing it in the sink with soapy dishwater and letting it airdry. But I guess this latest incident put it over the edge. I wish I could throw it in the washing machine, but for $17, getting a new one at this point is no big deal.
