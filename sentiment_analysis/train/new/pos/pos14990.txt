Cute!The water bottle itself is very cute. It's pink  and has Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy on the cover.  It reads best friends forever. How sweet.  It's a great item.  I loved it. It is very good. I think it is great for babies and big kids alike. I loved it the reason I didn't give it five stars was it was hard to open!! Other than that it's perfect! It may not be hard to open for you though.
