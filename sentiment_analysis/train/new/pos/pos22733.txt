We started off using the vented Dr Brown bottles & loved them as it seems to make a huge difference with swallowing air & causing gassiness. But the vent is needed with the nipple cap but when we mixed the formula clumps of unmixed powder gathered around & in the vent. So we got these caps to use to shake the bottle with powder & water to ensure its thoroughly mixed & dissolved before placing the vent & nipple cap. We also use it while out & about with a bottle of water & another bottle of the powder formula to mix up later when needed.
