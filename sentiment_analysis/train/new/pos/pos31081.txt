We received a hand me down Halo sleep sack from a friend with our first baby and although it was a larger size, it worked wonders for us and nighttime sleep. so we decided to buy the HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Cream, Newborn, and have been even more so pleased with this item!Don't be deceived by the fact that it appears your baby is sleeping in a straight jacket :) The tight velcro straps are far more effective than just a typical swaddle blanket in keeping your little one's arms nestled tightly against their body and preventing them from startling themselves with their reflexes popping off throughout the night.The material of the HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle is unbelievably soft. Even after, now, over 10 washes the material is still so so soft and comfortable on our baby. The velcro pieces are large and sturdy, and although they do get stuck occasionally most materials that it touches, they have not bunched up over time and they also do not fray the material that they stick too.Easy zip makes for easy access for diaper changes or any other access you may need into the swaddle.
