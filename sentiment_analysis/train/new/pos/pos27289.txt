These Baby Blocks, unlike most of the others I looked at, have NO chemical smell. Nor do they have sharp edges at the seams. My grandson (3 months old) likes to knock them down. My only complaint - the squeaker inside one of the blocks doesn't work very well. (We didn't know it actually squeaked for a while - just thought it had something hard in the center!) I would recommend these over other soft blocks.
