I wanted to share one of my favorite childhood stories with my son so I bought this to go along with the book. Who would've guessed he'd be obsessed with such a simple toy?! It's bright, cheerful and timeless. Unfortunately the elastic inside finally gave after 6 months of hard play with a now 15 m/o. He was so sad, he kept trying to pick up the scattered pieces off the floor ... I jumped on Amazon and ordered a replacement - the look on his face when he saw what came today was well worth it :)
