I own two of these sheets. They complement the nursery decor (green & orange with some brown). It's hard to tell but the dots are chocolate brown. The background is off-white/ivory ... not too creamy but also not bright white. The sheet is NOT fully elasticized but the elastic at either end has held up well through multiple washes. I wash both of these regularly and toss them in the dryer and they haven't stretched out, faded, or shrunk so far.
