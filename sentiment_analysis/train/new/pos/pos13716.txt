So this just arrived in the mail today. Cleaned it up and put it in front of my 4 1/2 month old daughter while she sat in the high chair. She got sooooooooooooo excited watching me clean it and I could tell she could not wait to get her little hands on it. The only other toy that has gotten this reaction from her has been an oball so she would definitely rate it a 5!The suction is really really good, I can't see her being able to yank this toy off her high chair for awhile so that's a definite plus... I hope it stays this strong! It's bright and colorful and the clicking sound it makes is great for little ears. A lot to do on a compact little toy. Loving it so far :)
