I love these nipples. Yes, they take an extra step to clean, but in my mind that is worth the benefit.My daughter was under 3 months old when I had to go back to work and I wanted something that would help defend against nipple confusion issues as well as still give her similar benefit of breast feeding (ie similar function of pressure and suction to keep good muscles forming, which helps with language later on etc). She did great with these nipples when given a bottle by me or by my husband.Once she was with the caretaker this was a different story. She did not want anything to do with these nipples and I ended up going to a back up that I had purchased which was like the pacifier that she tolerated The First Years Soothie Wide Neck Nipple Stage 1 - 2 Pack, 0-3 Months. The reason I say she 'tolerated' the pacifier is that clearly I have a baby that will never be addicted to a pacifier. She will take it peridocally and ONLY the soothie one (Wubbanub Infant Pacifier ~ Giraffe or Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2 Pack)Future babies (God willing!) will be started with these nipples when I cannot feed them myself and we shall see how they do with them.I'm a huge supporter of the concept and sincerely believe the extra cleaning step is worth while. In the end, the baby has to decide for herself!
