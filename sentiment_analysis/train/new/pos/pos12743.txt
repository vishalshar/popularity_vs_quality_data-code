We have these in all the colors available. I've been using them daily for about two months and have not had any issues so far. I steam sterilize and scrub them everyday and they've done a fantastic job of holding up to the wear and tear. My daughter absolutely adores these. Earlier on, I had wished that they held a little bit more liquid because she was quickly finishing these and wanting more, but now she eats more solids so this is a good size. I started these with her around 4 months and she's loved them ever since. We will be moving up to a more traditional sippy cup soon, but these are so fabulous for those parents that want to have their child start to learn to self feed with the bottle. The handles are nice and rubbery so baby can chew on those too. The nipples are really good about not leaking when held upside down or tossed around. Just be sure you rinse the opening of the nipple well, things can build up in there if you're not careful.Overall, I would recommend these to everyone. They're awesome!
