The bottles pictured here are the honey colored, polyether sulfone variety.The wide mouth sold me to these bottles.  We switched to these bottles from Evenflo Classic Glass Bottle 8 oz, 6-Pack and Breastmilk Bottle Set-8oz. These bottles were appropriate when our little one was breast feeding as they fit Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with Shoulder Bag perfectly. However, when we stopped breast feeding and started forumla, it was very difficult to scoop formula into these bottles. In contrast the mouth of the Philips Avent BPA Free Bottle, Dual Pack, 9 ounce (being reviewed) is nearly 2 inches in diameter making it very easy to scoop formula into them whether it be on the road or early in the evening.While many reviewers found this bottle to leak, I did not, even with Philips Avent Fast Flow Nipple, BPA-Free nipples I ordered separately. However, I can see how if put together quickly the bottles *could* leak. The nipples contain an overhanging lip, which if seated improperly onto the bottle, will fail to cause a seal with the bottle and leak. To circumvent this, I pull the nipple through the ring until it is well seated and then screw the ring/nipple onto the bottle. I have yet to have a single leak.Price! The bottles are rather on the expensive side, even when available as a two-pack!. While I found the wide-neck to be excellent, a more frugal buyer may consider Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 oz - 3-Pack. While one can speculate the reason behind the cost difference, the bottles being reviewed are made in Europe. Maybe it's the 'Philips' brand name.
