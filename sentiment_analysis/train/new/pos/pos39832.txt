We have been using this umbrella stroller for 9 months now. It is really great. We used a Graco snap n' go type stroller frame and loved that until we couldn't use it anymore. This is a great next step as it is light, fantastic for keeping in the trunk of your car for shopping trips, just like we used the stroller frame for. We also have flown a number of times already with our daughter and it has been great for wheeling through the airport as well as carrying when needed. Love that it stands on its own. It opens very easily and is almost a one handed close. I am 5'8" and my husband is 6'3" and the handle height and stride length are excellent for us, we don't hunch over and we don't kick the stroller when we walk even when we are hustling. Sure I would love the storage to be even larger underneath, but its an umbrella stroller, I'm not sure how they could make it any bigger. I find it even works for quick grocery shopping trips, I can get a gallon of milk, quart of yogurt, etc etc under there just fine. The shade on top is truly fantastic and the material the stroller seat is made of feels great.Something to note is that ours and our neighbors was a little stiff at first when opening. I had to really pull the handles apart and press down with my foot. That has gotten much better over time.
