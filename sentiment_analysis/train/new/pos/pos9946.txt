We use it in the bath and it lathers nicely with the Aveeno body wash we use.  I only have three kids, but having five in the package allows each child to have their own and to have a couple of spares, which is always nice.I would have given it 5 stars, but two minor things:1) Only one comes with both sides textured like the green one.  My son actually prefers to wash with that side.2) With only five washcloths, would think they can come up with more than 4 different patterns for the back; two of the cloths have the same smooth pattern, one has a fuzzy backing, one has a "scrubby" backing, and the last has a different pattern with smooth texture.
