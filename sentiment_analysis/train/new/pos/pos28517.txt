This product took quite a long time to arrive, almost a month. The seller did not actually let me know about this, but gave a flimsy excuse about notification of shipping. If I like an item, I can wait for a lengthy time frame before I receive it. I just like to know in advance.I thought the entire teether was going to be plastic. The Hello Kitty is plush. It is a cute to attach to a stroller or car seat. It will fit well with my gift item. It is a bit pricey. I will not purchase from this company again due to the length of shipping time.
