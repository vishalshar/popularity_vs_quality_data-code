This is a great addition to the Pack 'n' Play. My son sleeps so much sounder on the mattress than he did on the hard surface of the PnP. It is firm, which is fine for us--that's recommended. My son is 16 months old. I'm not sure I would want to use this for little infants. It fits snuggly, but I'd still be concerned about the baby getting stuck between the mattress and the frame. Just something to consider. I think it's good for kids once they are able to crawl and get themselves out of situations :-)
