I am so pleased with this purchase.  This is a well constructed foot muff that is soft and fleecy on the inside and waterproof on the outside.  It fits perfectly on the City Mini with a slit for the grab handle that folds the stroller so that it still folds perfectly.  It also has slits for the belts (although we found that we had to have the belts adjusted higher than normal when using the muff).  We were still able to pack the stroller in its carrying case with the muff attached, so no problems there.  This muff kept my son warm and dry throughout a recent month long trip in cold weather.  This is maybe one of the smartest things I have ever purchased!  See more about the City Mini and other accessories on my review at [...]
