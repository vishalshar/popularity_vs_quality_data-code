I am very happy with this product.  I noted some bad reviews and kept my fingers crossed that it would work for me.  I purchased this to protect my Christmas tree from my young pup.  It is sturdy enough to stand itself and does just what I bought it for.  It also looks pretty cute around the tree!  It is made from an MDF material as many pointed out not wood and there were a couple of little paint chips on opening up the package hence I dropped a star!  These can easily be filled in though so not a problem for me!
