Being a first time parent, Iâ€™m nervous about trimming the nails of my two-month baby. I have carefully pay attention to the safety question and regrettably I have done terrible works as a parent. Therefore, I decided to buy a clipper with a magnifying glass. These are very comfortable and safe to make a clean, smooth and nice trim. Indeed, the trimmer helps a lot to my cutting and make no dangers. I think this is a must for me for it avoids accidents. I will give this five stars and recommend to every new parent.
