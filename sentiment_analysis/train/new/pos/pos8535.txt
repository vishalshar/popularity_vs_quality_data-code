I was looking for an album to give to my mother-in-law (for photos of our new baby), and I came across this.  Much cooler than an album.  She liked it a lot, so I ordered one for my mom.  I don't remember if it was clear from the description, but the fabric is something softer than canvas.  There was a little black smudge on it when it arrived, but it came off with a damp towel.  Great gift for anyone who still likes actual prints.
