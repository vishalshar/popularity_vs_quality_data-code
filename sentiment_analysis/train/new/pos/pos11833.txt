I read some really bad reviews on the product and still went ahead to buy because the price was very attractive. I understand that some reviewers spent $200 on this and expected perfect performances.Yes, it does shut down your wireless router just like when I pick up my 2.4GHz telephone. But when you turn the baby camera off, your router comes back to life automatically. The camera does not seem to interfere with my X10.com audio/video sender (used for my FTA satellite receiver for foreign TV). I can use the audio/video sender to watch TV and the baby monitor at the same time with good pictures for both. When I select particular channels, I can even use the baby monitor to watch the TV signal sent by the audio/video sender. Nice! I also have an X10 wireless surveillence camera. One of the baby monitor's channels can pick up the video signal from the X10 camera clearly. This is nice for me since I turn the X10 camera on only when someone knocks on my door. If you turn the X10 camera on all the time, I guess you lose a channel.The LCD viewing angle is narrow as mentioned by other reviewers. The statics on the voice channel of the LCD monitor are indeed obvious. If I turn the volume down, I don't hear much statics and it still can pick up baby's cry.A happy buy for me! I really love the multiple uses. Buy the way, the night vision is awesome and the LCD minitor has built-in rechargeable battery!
