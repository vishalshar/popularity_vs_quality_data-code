Our baby girl is 11 weeks old.  We bought her the fisher price sugar plum swing honestly...only for the looks.  Little did we realize it's super loud and the motor started to make a clicky noise after just 5 days!  I then got online and read horrible reviews about the swing so my husband and I went back to BRU and exchanged it for the less expensive, luv u zoo cradle swing and it was the best decision ever!  We've owned it for over 2 months and never looked back!I have to disagree with the previous reviewer that posted a bad review saying the motor is loud.  It Is super quiet!  The trick to it is if you hear the motor at all, just separate the legs farther apart again and it will be quiet again.  The key for it to stay quiet is the legs to stay the farthest apart possible.It also has a cute mirror and mobile and multiple speeds and cute music.  It is also attractive to have in your living room,  neutral colors.  Also another huge huge plus, it has an electric cord too!  No need for batteries!If you are contemplating this swing, get it!  Especially since amazon has it cheaper than BRU.  We like it so much, we are about to repurchase another one for a newborn nephew as a gift.  Hope this helps~
