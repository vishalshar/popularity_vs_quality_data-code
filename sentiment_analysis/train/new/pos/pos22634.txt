My little man enjoys chewing and playing with his burp cloth and blankets and can't grip things easily yet, so I thought I'd give this a go.  It's AWESOME!  It's actually a little overstimulating for him sometimes since the center of the alligator has a loud crinkling noise to it, but he likes it a lot.  Lots of textures for him to feel too.  Great for both chewing and playing.
