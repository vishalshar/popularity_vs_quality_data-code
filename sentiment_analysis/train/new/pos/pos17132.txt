I got this slip cover for my Born Free pillow, since reading many reviews that the original cover that comes with the pillow is extremely difficult to put back on once washed. I love that the cover comes in a few different fabric designs - I got the diamonds in green. I like that it's a neutral colour.The cover is pretty easy to slip on, although it does get a bit stuck around the very curled part - it was expected. It's great that there are ties to fasten the cover in place, as this is easy and hassle free. Since the pillow itself is not that expensive, I would suggest getting the slip cover as well, especially if you will be using it for breastfeeding and a play pillow for your toddler.
