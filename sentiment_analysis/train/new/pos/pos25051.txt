I love this sling!  But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.I've found the key is wear it high!  The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height.  It's true!  If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she's going to squirm and be uncomfortable.I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving.  Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he's in it he falls asleep, no matter the time of day.  If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he'll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won't hear a peep out of him the whole trip.And you have to admit it's so cute and stylish!  Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon!
