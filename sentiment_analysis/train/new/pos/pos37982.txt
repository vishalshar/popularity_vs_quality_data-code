Great bottle brush. The nipple brush in the handle makes it really convenient to wash nipples (use the large side to wash the large area of the nipple and flip it over to wash the skinny area of the nipple without having to change equipment. The bottle brush side is great for washing bottles, but the blue ring sponge doesn't quite make it into the shorter bottles (I use the 5oz Medela Breastmilk Bottles), so it isn't useful yet, but will be when I transition to the 8oz bottles.The only two suggestions I would make is to have the nipple sponge wider at the base, so you could wash the nipple with one side of the brush, and to have a little wider base for the brush to stand on. It's a flat bottom, but is easy to knock over. I keep mine in a cup so I don't knock it over, which requires me to drain the water in the cup after every wash, so a more stable bottom might be helpful. Other than than, I've had my current one for over 2 months, so it's time for a replacement. It's 3-4x the cost of the cheapo ones, but worth it for sure.Also, the blue sponge tip is threaded through, so can shift to one side or the other, but is easy to pull back through to center. Mine started doing that after I had it for about a month.
