The sentiment here is adorable.  I really like this, and was so happy to give it to my goddaughter. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the bracelet, while sterling silver, doesn't seem to be constructed very finely.  I felt like one or two of the larger beads looked like it had been fused together with glue.  It detracted from the "fanciness" of the bracelet.  Also, I wish the bracelet had some kind of clasp, as opposed to being stretchy with elastic cord.  To me, an elastic corded design isn't something that seems like it would be a keepsake item saved from infancy to adulthood.Again, the item itself is a very sweet sentiment.  I like the fairytale color scheme and sweet poem.  The plastic of the "frame" is sturdy and thick.  But my reservations with the bracelet come down to the details of the bracelet, and keep it from earning a 5 star review.
