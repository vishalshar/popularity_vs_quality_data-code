I was worried this would be too light based on the photo but I was happy to see it was the exact gray I was looking for when it arrived. It's darker than it looks here so against the white high chair it's a good contrast. I ordered this because I didn't like the bright colors that the boon chairs come with. This helped tone down the chair in my kitchen, I also bought the clear tray liner to replace the orange liner it came with. Again, looks less bright in my toned down modern kitchen. I'm glad they have this option available.
