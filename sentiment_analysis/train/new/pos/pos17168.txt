I read many of the reviews, as I normally do when I buy something on Amazon. I make sure that I read the bad ones and the good ones. One of the major complaints about this product was that it has mold in the threads of the lid. I don't see how that's even possible especially since the rubber ring is removable. I posted a picture for you to see. Either way even if mold grows in the threads of the lid, its nothing that can't be removed by either a fine brush for bottles, or perhaps some sort of solution like bleach. Either way, I did not see this as a terrible problem with this cup.The next complaint was about the lid coming off when the toddler throws the cup on the ground. Not only did I test it first, but also my toddler actually did throw this on the ground, and the lid stayed on perfectly. No leaks.It took him a few tries and some modeling for him to coordinate how to drink from the cup, but once he figured it out, he preferred this cup.This is pretty thick plastic and pretty easy to take apart. I have included a picture to show how it comes apart. There may be one small section that is hard to clean, eventually, under the center "button" but I was able to get it with my finger in a cloth. The lid is hard plastic with a soft, flexible silicone top that can be removed to clean.
