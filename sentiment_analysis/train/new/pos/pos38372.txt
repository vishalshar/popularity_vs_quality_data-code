I haven't had any of the issues with the bag sticking to itself like some of the other reviewers, so I'm guessing that means that they fixed their supply issues. The bag fits the bin perfectly. It's very high quality, and washes great.  I bought two so that I have one in the bin while the other is in the wash. I think this is a must have for any cloth-diapering parents.
