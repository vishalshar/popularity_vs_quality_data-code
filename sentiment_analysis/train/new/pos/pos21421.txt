I used this pump for over a year and never had a problem with it.  I read a lot of negative reviews and chose to purchase it anyway, and I was not disappointed. I was looking for a pump for occasional use that was affordable.  I am a stay at home mom, so I needed a pump that I could use occasionally when I was away from baby.I never had a problem getting suction.  Yes, it does work better when it is plugged in than when using it on battery power, but the batteries do work if you need it.  Some people complained that it leaked if you were not leaning forward.  I never had a problem with that.  You might not be able to using it leaning backwards, but it works just fine if you are sitting in a normal position.It does not have as much power when used with batteries as it does when it's plugged in, but it still does the job.It says right in the description it is for occasional use only, and I wonder if some of the negative reviews come from overuse.I would definately recommend this to a mom who needs a pump to use for occasional use. It beats buying a $300 pump.
