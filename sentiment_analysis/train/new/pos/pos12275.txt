When my son was born, he liked to sleep with blankets over his face and liked to be "sweaty" warm - both issues posed safety issues.  I found the original Breathable Blanket and it was perfect.  I would say the old style blankets were better, but the new softer ones serve the same purpose.  You can fold these things up as small as you want and still breathe through them.  They keep the child very warm without causing the baby to perspire.  Of all the junk we spend money on today, this is an absolute MUST HAVE  for parents with infants today.  Buy more than one because if one is in the wash or gets left somewhere, the kids won't sleep without them!
