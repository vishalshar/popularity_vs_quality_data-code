love it!!!!! I keep finding this kind of bottle warmer for a long time, and i am extremely  satisfied with it. cause it wont automatic shut off and keep the bottle warm forever!!!I have Dr brown, kiinde and this one, cause i want to compare.Dr brown is fast have the time setting, steaming the bottle sometimes is hard to control the temperature, some time it is too hot in the center or is not hot enough.Kiinde is ok, with the high tech, which heat the bottle evenly but it wont  keep the bottle warm for a longer time.and this is the best because i can heat the water for the next meal, when it is time to feed the baby, i can just put the formula into the warm water, and if my baby did not finish  i can use this to keep the bottle warm for a little bit longer when i wake her up again( also you have to trash the milk within one hour)
