I bought this in white and was impressed by the quality and price.  Much nicer than the Carters Super Soft Dot cover that only comes in ecru but not white.  The size and contouring is perfect for the LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32", White that has rounded corners. Will be purchasing another as a back-up.
