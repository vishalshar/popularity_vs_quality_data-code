I had no idea just how horribly-designed most baby wipes containers were until we recently had our first child.  I'm not an engineer by any means, but even I recognize the need for sealing out air if one is trying to retain moisture/humidity -- something most baby wipe box designers failed to consider, it seems.PRO's:--Sturdy.  Heavy.  Difficult to shift around by accident or, worse, have fall off your changing table at a critical moment.--High-capacity; holds at least a single large pack of wipes without issue.--Retains wipes' moisture: lid is actually lined with a gasket to prevent evaporation.  Works well.--The "plate" inside ensures only a single wipe comes out at once.  Nice!CON's:--Heavy and large.  Not quite something I'd call "portable," so it's best for in-house use at a single location.  Not a huge negative--just wanted to reinforce just how bulky and heavy this box is.--Gasket still allows for a very slow evaporation of wipes' moisture.  We have two of these, so I've verified it's the case with both.  Even with the gasket-lined lid, the wipe at the very top is slightly less damp than those beneath.  Still 500% better than a typical wipes container with huge air gaps.--Wipes come out in multiples unless you first *remove them from all packaging* (don't just open the plastic top and leave them in there--makes all the difference)BOTTOM LINE:--We've tried a number of wipes containers, and these are the best by far.  Not really meant for travel, and pricier than one might expect, but excellent nonetheless.  Highly recommended for home use!(  Oxo also makes a similar-looking travel-friendly wipes container but, sadly, it lacks the gasket around the lid; as such, wipes within it dry out fairly quickly. )
