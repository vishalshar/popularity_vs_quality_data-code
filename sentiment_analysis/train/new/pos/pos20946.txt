I had bought  the umbrella stroller from First Years to keep at my parents' house and was pleasantly surprised by it's ease of use and smooth ride--all for just $20. When my regular stroller (high end stroller by a different company) was getting to be too much of a hassle for me to lug around and break down into its 4 different pieces just to put in the trunk of my car,  I knew I had to replace it with a stroller by First Years. I searched on amazon and found this Via stroller with no reviews. I took my chances and purchased it anyway. I'm so glad I did!  This stroller has a smooth ride, much smoother than other strollers in the same price range.  The push handles are adjustable so that it can accomodate varying heights and, although I kick the back wheels sometimes when I walk, I do have a long stride and I found that I kick the back wheels  of other stroller brands more frequently.  The stroller folds easily, I do not have to adjust it in any way or take anything off of it in order to collapse it.  It also reclines almost flat and the seatback seems supportive enough so that there is no concern about your child's posture or slouching.  I also appreciate the five point harness with the option of just using the lap belt. The seat is nice and deep and padded well enough. My little girl rarely complains while riding in this stroller. Lastly, I have to say, the basket underneath is wonderful. There's so much space!  I can fit my heavy jacket, my daughter's jacket, my purse, and there's room to spare for other items.  I highly recommend this stroller. Nice work, First Years!
