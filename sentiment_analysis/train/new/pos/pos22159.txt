We took this chair on vacation with us and our 2 month old daugher loved to hang out in it - by the pool, on the deck, at the beach, everywhere!  It kept her nice & cool with the mesh back and was easy to keep clean of the sand.  It has a nice bounce to it as it lulled her to sleep - she took most of her naps in this and seemed to just love it.  The Tiny Love mobile attachment works great with it too. This chair is must have for summer babies!!
