While not a perfect fit, it fits securely enough on the side of our Graco Pack N Play. We are able to stack plenty of diapers in the diaper dispenser and set a pack of wipes on top. Some reviews mentioned diapers slipping through the bottom opening of the dispenser. We've not experienced this. Our 7 week old currently uses size 1 diapers, for reference. Perhaps smaller newborn sizes are more prone to slipping out.The side compartments are great for storing other items you may want readily available such as lotion, diaper rash creams, and grooming tools. We love how organized it keeps our changing system-- way better than having to run to the nursery for diapers or having to bend down and gather items from a diaper caddy that sits on the ground. This product allows our Pack N Play to double as an efficient changing station, keeping all the products we need conveniently within reach every time we go to change a diaper. Highly recommend to anyone who is currently using a Graco Pack N Play as their baby's crib and/or changing station.While this is organizer is compatible with the Pack N Play, I don't recommend it for an actual full-size crib though. Our crib is made of wood and the sides are far too thick for this diaper caddy to hang on to.
