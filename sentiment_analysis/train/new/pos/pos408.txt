So, this is my third baby, and my first attempt at cloth diapering. I have run into trouble finding diapers that are as easy to use as disposables but these ones actually are. They snap where the little tape flaps would be and because there are multiple snaps they actually are a more customized fit. *I just wanted to put this out for any other moms like myself that are looking for cloth diapers that are set up, and put on like disposables. These ones Are!
