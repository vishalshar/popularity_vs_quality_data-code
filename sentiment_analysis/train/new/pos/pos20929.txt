I love this swing.  I set it up in under an hour with a 4 year old demanding my attention and a crying baby. It's simple and easy to use as well which is also nice.  The choice of music (loud, quiet, and none) is also nice since my son tends to like having noise while he sleeps.Honestly you can't judge the performance of the swing by how finicky a baby is.  Some of the comments are based on the child's preference rather than the functionality of the swing itself.  The mobile is at a good height.  Low enough to see and high enough that it can be batted at but NOT grabbed.  My son loves staring at the mobile, but he also loves watching people moving about.  The swing allows you to swing your child at a faster and slower speed based on your preference.  (At a lower speed your child won't slump forward if he's sitting up..)Being able to collapse makes it easy to store and side pockets are great for pacifiers and putting stuffed animals into to peak over the side (this adds to visual stimulation for the baby :) )I love this swing, I find it a life saver when it comes to opening up some time for yourself.  (Dishes have to get done you know..)It's quiet, doesn't take up a lot of room and is rather comfy for a baby.
