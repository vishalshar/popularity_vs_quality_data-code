I bought this after watching my 6 month old stare covetously at the one at the daycare. It is a hit. She loves it. We call it the thwappy chair because she can spend half an hour thwapping things. It has a really good progression in that there are things that she figured out right away, because they respond to the most random wacking...and there are things like the octopus and the turtle which require a more skilled activation sequence. It has also changed my life, because I can stick her in it when we first get home, and it keeps her from howling for tit for the whole 7 minutes that it takes to wash my hands, put the milk in the fridge and pee...not necessarily in that order.
