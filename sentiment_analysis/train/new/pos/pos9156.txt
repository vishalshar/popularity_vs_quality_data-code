First I have to say  I did not use these for a crib. I had bought a new dining table and chairs, counter height, and my husband could not keep his feet off the bottom rails. He was ruining the finish and they were always dirty. I was searching for something to put on them and THESE ARE PERFECT! They slide on, they are soft not hard and clear.I put them on and he never even noticed them.  I LOVE this fix! I have more chairs and I will be buying another set!
