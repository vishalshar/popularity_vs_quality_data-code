You'll love the result, but hate the install.  This product is a great, inexpensive way to dress up a wall and it looks terrific once it's installed. The product deserves 5 stars for how it looks, only 3 stars for the following:1) Itâ€™s very tricky to install2) Instructions were poor3) Product arrives cut in 7-8 unlabeled pieces and it's not obvious how they go together4) Our product arrived incomplete and I had to create my own piece out of scraps to finish one branch section (probably a fluke, but worth a mention)A few words of advice on install:1) BE PATIENT! And follow what instructions are there. Plan on spending several hours to get it right.2) Make sure wall is clean, dry and smooth. I don't think this product would well on anything less than smooth, eggshell or semi-gloss painted drywall.3) Have a helper, tough to manage larger sections alone.4) Cut larger sections apart, when possible; easier to manage.5) Once decal is laid on wall, don't pull backing off too fast. Rub as you pull backing away to keep decal from lifting. The decal can pull away with the backing and you'll stretch or tear it, especially in thinner, more delicate sections (learned the hard way once!)Good luck.  As I said, the final results are great!
