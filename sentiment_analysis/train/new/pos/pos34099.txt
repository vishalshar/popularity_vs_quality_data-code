My mom bought me a 4 in 1 car seat to go from infant to booster seat, at the time I thought that was great, until I needed to place and remove my infant.  We decided to use ore safely first infant carrier instead so we purchased this base and it worked perfectly! So much easier to place and remove the carrier than the baby!
