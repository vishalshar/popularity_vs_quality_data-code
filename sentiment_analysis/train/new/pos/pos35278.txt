My son needed a nap mat for his preschool, and we are very happy with this one.  The blanket is very soft and it rolls up nicely with Velcro straps to keep it in a roll and a little nylon handle - very convent for getting it to and from the car.  The pillow is easily removed for washing.  I whish the pillow were a little firmer (after 1 week it was already getting flat) but I can buy a better one if I choose and insert it into the casing.  The name tag is also removable, which will be nice if this gets passed down to a younger sibling.
