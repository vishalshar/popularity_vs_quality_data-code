Overall  it commend this to anyone trying to get help with their kid going to bed.  My 3 yr old totally bought in from the moment we bought it.  I never read her the book or did the incentive chart because she just "got it". My 2 yr old is getting there, but it wasn't as immediate with him. He now comes to me in the morning and announces, "Sleep buddy off."  It does help if either wake up in the middle of the night. They don't stay in their room and go back to bed always, but now I just walk them back in, point to sleep buddy, say, "Sleep buddy's on, it's time to sleep," and they go back to bed no fuss and don't bargain to go downstairs. It almost works too well in that if you want to sleep past sleep buddy, no dice unless you changed the timer the night before to go off later.  I love that it also programs for naps, not something the other clocks did.  It also serves as a nightlight, which helped my kids a lot in their dark rooms.  The reason for four stars: it has three dimming settings, I wish it had four or five (I think the lowest is still bright), and it isn't the easiest to program. It's not "hard", more annoying that you have to cycle through everything to get to the choices.  You do a lot of toggling to get it done and it's not quick to double check.  Also, wish you could have battery back-up for power outages or travel.
