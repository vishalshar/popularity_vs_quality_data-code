Love this sheet. We live in north Dakota and the nights get very cold. The jersey material doesn't get the cold wet feeling that lots of plain cotton sheets do. This sheet has deep pockets enough to fit any crib mattress with mattress pad. Launders well and no pilling. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that out of package it does have a chemical smell but once I washed it twice the smell was gone so it's a minor inconvenience.
