Never have to worry about not having a variety of "snacks" on hand anymore.  I have a picky eater and you never know what he is in the mood for (okay, yes, he's spoiled).  This allows me to pack a variety of snacks (Kix, Cherrios, raisins, dried cranberries, even pre-measured formula) for on the go.  It's also a great way to pack for the sitters/daycare if you have to provide your own formula.  Pre-measure up to five bottles. Convenience with a little is the key and this helps!
