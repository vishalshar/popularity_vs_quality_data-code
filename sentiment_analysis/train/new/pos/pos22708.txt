Our 5-month old baby spits up A LOT, and those other little bibs just don't cut it.  The mess would run right down them and all over her clothes.  These, however, are great!!  They cover the length of her torso, plus her shoulders, and the fabric really catches the mess so it rarely gets on her clothes (or me) anymore.  My only problem now is I need more!
