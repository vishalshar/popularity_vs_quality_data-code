We ordered these not because we needed them for childproofing, but because they're longer then regular door stops. We do have small children (5, 3, and 5m), but we don't go crazy and bubble wrap everything in the house. I'm sure these would be appreciated by people that do that though. They're all one molded piece, and they screw right into the hole where the previous door stop was.Our issue was that because of the design of our doorways and style of door handles (and the way our kids open the doors with great abandon), we had dents in the walls where the handles kept hitting the drywall. The door stops just weren't long enough. These did the job perfectly! We repaired the dents and now our walls are staying dent free! I would recommend these for anyone having the same problem we did.
