Great for younger babies because this is fairly low to the ground. It is also wide, so it's not as easy to topple over, though you still have to pay attention especially if you are doing EC with younger ones who are squirmy and aren't so good at sitting on their own yet. I would recommend adding rubber feet to the bottom to prevent slipping on hard, slippery floors.For those of you who are particular about your colors, the lime green on this is very yellow.
