This is my absolute favorite bib for my solid-eating babe! He was never in to puree's, and only has ever really eaten solids broken down into small pieces that he can feed himself......thus resulting in a ton of food dropping EVERYWHERE. This bib has been my saving grace in the food-catching department! Some additional pluses in my eyes:-I can easily spray this and wipe it clean immediately thereafter (allowing you to get away with just the one if you so wish), OR, if I don't have time, you can just throw it in the dishwasher! Kinda amazing...-The little neck hooks are the same material as the bib, and do not rub the skin at all as a lot of other bibs with velcro closures tend to do....-Not stiff in the least bit (like the bjorn bibs!)Just buy it - you'll thank me later.
