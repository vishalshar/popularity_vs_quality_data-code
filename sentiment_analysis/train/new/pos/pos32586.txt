We recently purchased and have been happily using the Quinny Buzz Stroller.  After looking at many strollers (bugaboo, stokke, peg perego, etc)  we chose the quinny.  We have also previously owned, Aprica, Macleren, Graco and Peg Perego strollers.  We love how it unfolds at a touch (safety band prevents accidental unfolding) and it is by far the smoothest stroller on all kinds of terrain, from your neighborhood sidewalk to traversing across a grassy park.  I personally love the way it looks and it doesn't have the strolling spectacle flavor of say the stokke.  I also was concerned about the ease of use and unfolding/folding because of earlier reviews on the the Quinny.  However, this must have been a problem that was worked on by the manufacturer, as we find the quinny extremely simple to use, and although folding does require a bit of strength, once you get used to it you know exactly where and how to push down so that it folds quite easily.  The only major flaw I found and to me it's literally a "massive" flaw, is that it is so HUGE when it is folded.  It is so big it will undoubtedly take up most of your vehicle's trunk as it does ours.  We have the Audi Q7, and we cannot use half of the third row if we want to fit the stroller in back.  Our Peg Perego and Macleren both fit very nicely.  A secondary flaw is the short sun-shade, which the manufacturer somewhat compensates for by providing a zip-in windshield.  Our stroller came with a basket which I believe is new, as older reviews talked about the lack of a basket and constantly kicking a bag that attached to the rear.  The basket though not huge is adequate for us and we can easily fit a 12"x10"x5" diaper bag in it with some extra bottles of water.  In conclusion, if you can handle the large size and weight, it is indeed an excellent and very stylish stroller that works well in all conditions.
