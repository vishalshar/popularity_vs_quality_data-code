I used a Medela Freestyle before - it's such a big purchasing mistake!  The suction was too weak and I was getting lumps in my breast from not being properly emptied.  My friend had bought a symphony and said it was well worth the investment and since I have twins, it's value for money.  I can empty my breasts in 5-8 minutes versus the freestyle which took me 15 minutes (and not even properly emptied!)The only downside is that this product is of course not very portable as it is very very heavy!!
