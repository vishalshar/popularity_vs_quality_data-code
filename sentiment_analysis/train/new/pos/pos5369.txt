I received a celebration candle at my baby's shower years ago and we had the candle burning every year on her birthday until she was 21!  it was a very special tradition for us.  I was over joyed to find these candles were still made.  This will be my go tobaby shower gift from now on. Everyone I have shown it too loves it. I am overjoyed my new grand daughter can have one too.
