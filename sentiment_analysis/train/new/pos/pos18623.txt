I really like these latches.  You do need to ensure that the mounting surface is very clean before attaching them or the tape will come un-stuck.  When the tape came off after 3 years (3 years!) I removed the residue and old tape, and was able to use high quality double-sided foam tape to re-attach.  It seems just as secure now as it did before.
