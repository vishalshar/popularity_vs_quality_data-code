So, Let me start my review by saying not being able to pick the color is annoying (I have a bruiser of a boy & received 2 pink handles), but at least the colors offered match the Avent label on the bottles, so it's not that big of a deal.  My boy finds these handles really easy to use.  We owned 2 Avent bottles (our only bottles because he exclusively breastfeeds) & when his doctor encouraged starting him on sippy cups with a little bit of water (6months), I really didn't want the bottles to go to waste.  I am thrilled that Avent offers these handles (& their Non Spill Soft Spouts).  The handles are perfect for little hands & giving the consumer the option to modify what they already own is ingenious.
