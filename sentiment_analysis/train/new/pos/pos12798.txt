This is the regular Bugaboo snack tray with an adapter that attaches to the Bee frame. It is just what I was looking for. I leave the adapter on the Bee and switch the tray between the Bee and the Donkey. It really is an excellent product. The tray also pops out so it can be used as a cup holder only. We use the munchkin 360 cups and they fit perfectly.
