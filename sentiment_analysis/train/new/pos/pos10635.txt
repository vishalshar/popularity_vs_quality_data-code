I seem to have a need to buy everything by Ergo Baby, specially if its limited edition or no longer made, I use this for whenever I am wearing my baby because I need my hands free and nothing else on my shoulder, it holds nice amount of stuff, I think I can fit a small wallet ( definitely mens wallets, maybe a small womens) in there.I usually stuff in it: keys, cell phone, as much cards as you need, pocket napkins, a small snack, and a pacifier, and theres still room for more.
