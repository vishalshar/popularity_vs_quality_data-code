Awesome sack!  I've tried 4 brands and this is my fave for the 2.5 tog (warm one).  I like the Love to Dream best for the .5 and 1.5 tog (light ones) in case you care.  It comes with a thermometer that tells you EXACTLY how to dress your baby to sleep at each temperature, and I would get this for any new mom just based on that alone!  I'll include a pic.  It's brilliant!!!!  The sack is warm and comfy, and the "free add on" thermometer is so great that they should send one home with every mom from the hospital!  Oh, and unlike many other sacks, this one is machine dryable - which means you don't need a (expensive) back up sack for when you have to wash it.  Well built and well designed.
