This item is great!  I bought this instead of the Bumbo seat for a few reasons.1.)  This one came with a tray, toy, and 2 place mats for cheaper than I could have gotten the Bumbo seat with its accessories.2.)  I like how when my daughter sits in the BebePod, her legs are comfortably pointing downward instead of straight out like the Bumbo seat.3.)  I love the Kiwi color!!Others complained about a chemical smell - I never had that.A couple things I wish were a little different:1.)  I wish the backrest was not so rounded at the top and I like how the Bumbo seat has "arm rests" in a way.2.)  The BebePod is quite slippery and it looks like the Bumbo seat is not.  (I've never even touched a Bumbo seat though so I don't know for sure.)3.)  While the Bebepod is foam, it's a little harder than I expected.  I'm curious to know if the Bumbo seat is any softer.  On the other hand, I understand it can't be too soft or it wouldn't be safe enough for a baby to sit in it.But this product was great for what I was looking for!  My daughter is 14 weeks old and so far seems to enjoy it.  She's not quite coordinated enough yet to play with the toy, but I'm sure she'll love it.******UPDATE*********We absolutely LOVE the bebePod!  Our daughter is 8 months old now and it's one of her favorite places to be!  She ABSOLUTELY LOVES the toy it comes with and spends a long time contently playing with it!  She gets so excited when she sees it coming!VERY HAPPY with our decision to purchase this over the Bumbo seat.  We love how the tray slides in instead of just sits on top like the bumbo tray.  So far, the toy has yet to be pulled out of the tray by our daughter, which is something I was worried about.I put her in it while I shower and get ready for the day, giving me all the time in the world!!BUY IT!  You'll LOVE it!
