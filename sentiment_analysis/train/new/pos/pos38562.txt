This was cheaper deal compared to Aden + Anais burpy bibs.  So i gave it a try.but it is cheaper and you get what you pay for..compared to Aden+Anais,1. It is smaller: it still covers your shoulder enough but it is a little smaller.2. It does not have the snap buttons so it cannot be used as bibs.3. It is not as soft as Aden + Anais brand4. more lint come off when washedbut it absorb as well as Aden + Anais.cheaper than Aden brand.hope it helped
