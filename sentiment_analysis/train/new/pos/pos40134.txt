This item has a newer version that you may receive. The new version is no longer called the EcoCover and has been updated and renamed the Wee-a-way natural organic cotton mattress pad cover. Terrible name but doesn't make it a worse product. The packaging is different and the mattress cover is no longer imprinted with words/pictures as Colgate claimed there were complaints of the design showing through a crib sheet. The wee-a-way natural organic cover is also an inch wider as Colgate claimed the EcoCover got a little smaller after washing.
