Both my son and daugher use this one. They call it their race car toilet seat because it's red and zippy. It seems to be catching all the splashes and splatters and is sturdy enough for my five year old who is still afraid of falling in (poor guy). I have a bjorn toilet seat for upstairs, and I was going to get another of the same since the other worked so well, but it was so expensive compared to this one, so I decided to give this one a try! It seems to me like it's exactly the same thing, same quality and perhaps a little easier for the kids to put on the toilet.
