We bought the Soothie bottles #1 for their overall value and #2 lots of good reports on them.  I was not disappointed!  This is the best gift set you could ever give someone who is having a baby.  I just had my 4th child in August and she took to these bottles fantastically!  This set comes with handy containers to hold formula or snacks that attach to the bottom of the bottle and they lock in place and do not fall off!  These also do a wonderful job of venting air and do not leak.  They also provide the perfect flow for my newborn so she is not gulping and drooling down the side of her face. I used to use Avent, but they are so overly priced and after hearing all the bad reviews this year with the poor construction on them with their new BPA free line, I just decided it was not going to be worth the added cost.  Glad I made the change!
