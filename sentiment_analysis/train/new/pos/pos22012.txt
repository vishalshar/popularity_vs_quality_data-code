This is my third time of purchasing this particular gate.  I bought one a while back and placed in in my living room to keep my 10 year old Yorkie from climbing and possibly falling up and down the steps to our upstairs.  Not sure that my husband would approve of the design, he is an artist and very particular as to where and how things are placed. To my amazement, he really felt that out of all the gates around, this one was pretty good. We both like the idea of not placing holes in our walls and it is easy to move around. Since that first purchase, we have purchased three more.  Good price, great quality of workmanship. It is a nice little addition to and for the safety of our little guy! Highly recommend.
