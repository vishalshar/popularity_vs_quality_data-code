My 3 month old HATES being in the car. He'll cry and cry and when I try to give him his bottle he'll settle down until I can't tilt back the bottle any further. Then he just loses it. I purchased this because we were going on a road trip (Chicago to Milwaukee) and I wanted him to be able to eat and finish his food. We took this with us and it worked like a charm! I noticed he didn't like sucking and not getting anything right away (he's an instant gratification kind of baby). But, he managed to figure it out and it worked! Drank all his milk and fell asleep. This worked so well for us! It's fairly easy to set up. Pieces all fit,no spills or parts falling off easy. Cleaning takes a little effort but we don't use it everyday so it's not a big deal. The brush it comes with is the right size, cleans the tubes nicely. Also, not a lot of air gets in so he's not a gassy baby afterwards. Haven't had an issue with it yet! The nipple it came with was too big/long for my baby so I switched it out to one he does like and it fit just fine! I'm happy with this purchase because it really helped during our trip. I'm happy we can travel now!***Please rate my review as "helpful" if it helped you out because it helps me write quality reviews for other products. This is not a sponsored review.
