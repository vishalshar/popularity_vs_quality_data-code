Was looking for a really nice bedding set for a good value.  The picture makes it difficult to see the product very well so I was crossing my fingers that I would like it.  It arrived in two days and I was absolutely thrilled with it!  The comforter is adorable.  It's embroidered with nice quality fabric, great color quality and doesn't look cheap.  I would say that about all of the pieces, really.  The wall hangings are simply pillows with ties, but it actually makes them easy to hang because they are light.  The sheet is thin, but baby doesn't care.  My only complaint would be with the bumper.  It is one piece, which wouldn't be an issue, except that our crib has a solid back, so there is nowhere to attach it.  If it were in 4 pieces we could use three of them and simply leave the back portion off, but it doesn't give us that option.  I washed the set immediately after delivery (according to instructions) and it washed beautifully.  I chose to iron the valances and dust ruffle afterward, but probably could have lived without ironing, too.  Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase!
