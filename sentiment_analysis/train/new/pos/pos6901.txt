Yes, yes and Yes!  In conjunction with my new Berkey water purifier, I'm off the plastic water bottles completely.  For some uses I prefer the lower profile 18 oz kanteen however for most activities, I use the 27 oz like kanteen.  I prefer the sport top for my use; nice soft interface so less likely to damage a lip or tooth, makes a good seal. Easy to quickly clean and refill.  Well thought out product.
