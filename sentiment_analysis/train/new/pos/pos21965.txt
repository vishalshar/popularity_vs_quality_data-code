Great item, I love that I can take the rubber grips off the bottom so my daughter can actually roll across the carpet. The only down side to this walker is when you go to fold it up to put away, there is no way to lock it into the "folded up" position. It locks out when you extend it, but you have to be careful when you fold it up to put away because the bottom could drop and hit you. Smashed my ankles a few times. Great item, minor set back, worth it.
