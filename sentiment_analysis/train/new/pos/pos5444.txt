My husband and I thought it was such a cute towel! They are pricey but worth it compared to other towels I have purchased. It is thick and soaks up water well. I wish it was longer but I have noticed that most toddler towels are like this. When I was little most of the toddler towels I had came to a "V" in the back. I would recommend this item!
