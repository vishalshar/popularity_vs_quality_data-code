I'm writing this review to clear up some issues that the manufacturer has seemed to address in older versions.My wife and I received 2 of these as shower gifts since we are expecting twins. The box is pretty large and weighs around 80lbs. You should definitely assemble the crib in the room you plan on keeping it in because it won't fit through a normal doorway. It took me 50 minutes to assemble the first one by myself and about 30 minutes to do the second one.We got the Espresso color which is VERY nice. There was no weird chemical smell to either of them. It's possible that's something the manufacturer has addressed, or maybe it's not an issue with the Espresso finish. Either way, we were relieved to find they smelled fine.There were no scratches on any of the parts and everything was packaged really well. No missing screws either!THE PARTS ARE ALL LABELLED! Many older reviews mention that none of the pieces are labelled, but they are now!The mattress support has been changed from a solid flat wood panel to a lightweight metal and spring mesh which feels well-made and is easy to mount. According to past reviews, the older version had the instructions glued to the wood panel but now you get a separate instruction manual that is kept in a large plastic envelope zip-tied to the spring mattress so you can keep it safe until the next time you want to readjust the bed size.My wife and I are really pleased with how nice these cribs looks and how solid they feel after assembly. We definitely had our reservations considering how inexpensive they are compared to the cribs you find in the store, but honestly we're really happy.I'm not sure how well they'll hold up to scratching and chewing but that's an issue we'd have with any crib. The wood doesn't appear to be overly soft so hopefully it'll hold up for a long time. For the money, you really can't beat the quality here.
