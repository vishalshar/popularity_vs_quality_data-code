They really are the BEST Burp Cloth EVER!!!!  My son was a reflux baby, and the are very absorbent and soft after washing.  I panicked when I first saw them upon opening the package, but after they get washed, they "puff up" some, but still thin and flexible enough for easy handling. Thick and absorbent.  My son was going through 3-4 saturated burp cloths PER FEEDING.  These were the best.  I bought 4 packs almost 7 years ago, and he uses them as handkerchiefs (snot rags!) now.  I was them on Santize and sometimes with bleach with very hot water and dry them on High Heat.  I plan to use them as dust rags after he's gives them up as snot rags.
