These things are an arm saver... literally. I have two twins and I use these when they are up during the day during feeding time. I do not use these without supervision however (such as overnight in their cribs). One issue I had (that just has to do with the seller) was when I bought these I bought them both in purple dot, and they both look different... one is a brighter purple and has the little textured dots but the other is smooth without the dots. Not a big deal overall. These things are easy to clean, just throw in the washer/dry. They fit all bottle sizes (big, small, wide, etc. They look and feel very comfortable and fit easily around my children's heads and I even tried it around my own (my head was maybe a little too big but it wasn't bothersome at all). They have learned that when the pillow comes out they know its bottle time  and they are comfortable enough that I have had my twins fall asleep while eating (which is when I recommend removing the pillow). It is easy however for them to push it away from their face (and I haven't had any problem with them getting it trapped around their face or anything and they are 2.5months old) but just to make sure if you don't want your children sleeping with them, to just remove it if they fall asleep. Overall we really like these and it is nice when momma is trying to cook for the older kids but its bottle time for the little ones. Just put the baba buddy on, set them up to eat, and remove it when they are done! Highly recommend to anyone with multiples or busy mamas who just need a little break from holding bottles!!!
