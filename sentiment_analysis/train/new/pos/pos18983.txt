This was the boppy our friend wanted for her baby girl and we were thrilled to find it for her cheaper on amazon with prime shipping than if we bought it at babies r us or any other big store. shipped right away just in time for the shower and is a great support for nursing and snuggling a newborn. I have one for my children too as they were nursing and its really saves the arms from having to hold them up to the breast continuously.
