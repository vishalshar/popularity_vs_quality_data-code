After using some other brands of reusable wipes I wanted to try something better. I'm quite impressed with these wipes, the size is perfect, I usually only need one wipe and a spray bottle of plain water for all messes.I love that there's 2 sides to these wipes, especially when my daughter has a rash, the fleecy side is soft and gentle enough on her skin.They wash well too and don't shrink up too much when washing in hot water. They don't stain up too bad either which is a plus.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the product description is misleading. I was under the impression that these were organic cotton. However, only one side is organic cotton, the other is 100% polyester. The huge tag is also annoying so I had to cut all of them off.Overall, pretty good and would recommend to others.
