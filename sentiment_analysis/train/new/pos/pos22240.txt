I went back to work and this pump works better than my hospital grade one.  It travels easily because you can detach and reattach everything easily which makes it convenient to steralize after each use.  I love that you can hold it all in one hand while pumping and adjust the suction.  I have had no problems with it at all and think it is awesome for the price!
