We have been lucky enough to be blessed with a baby that is really not picky at all. These were the bottles we registered for (we actually started with glass) and baby took to them even while breastfeeding without an issue.  As he got older and could hold his own bottle and was drinking over 4 oz, the glass ones got to be too heavy, so I ordered the plastic instead.  I love the blue color. They have been through the dishwasher countless times and have not shown any signs of wear (other than when the dog got one and used it as his chew toy).  The nipples also haven't shown any signs of breakdown either.  All in all, love these bottles
