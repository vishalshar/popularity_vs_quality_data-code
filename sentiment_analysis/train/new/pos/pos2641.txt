I have used this for 3 years now and still works great and is in great condition. I love it because is big enough to put all the things for the baby and even some things for mommy too. great for traveling, that's my traveling bag! you can also attach it to the stroller very easily. the pockets on the side are big enough that you can put the baby bottles or even regular bottles of water. It has a lot of pockets inside, so you can have everything neat and organized. Also a great thing that has is that is not femenine at all so dads can use it too and help. Great price, great product and great material. Very happy with this backpack for years!!! I really recommend this products for parents!
