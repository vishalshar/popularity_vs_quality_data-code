We love our Fred! He works great and travels on the carpet pretty well. I would suggest you read the instructions-I thought at first he moved very slow (too slow for my son) but then I realized there was a button for slow/fast. Once pushed the little dog was off with my son following behind. It has quickly become one of his favorite toys. I have noticed that it doesn't always move well on carpet that is very fluffy. It works great in our living room (walked on a lot) but not as well on the carpet in the nursery (not walked on as much) but my son loves it wether it is moving or being chewed on.
