We LOVE this product at my house. My 16 month old likes to scoop all of her bath toys up with the net.  As a mom, I love that there are no holes for water to get into it which will not cause mold.  It's easy to clean. I also love that when bath time is over I can literally scoop all of her bath toys up with the net. We've had it for about 2 months and so far so good.
