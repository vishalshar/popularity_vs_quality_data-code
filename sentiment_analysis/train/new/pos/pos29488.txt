Yes, Pods are bulky like maxi pads, but they are a good alternative to pull-ups. I only use them when we are out of the house for in-case-of-accidents. My 25 month old is potty trained, but he still has the occassional accident, particularly on long trips if we can't get him to a restroom fast enough. This is my second box of Pods. I purchased the first for my now 5 year old when I potty trained him three years ago.
