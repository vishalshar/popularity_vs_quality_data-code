The manufacturer instructions say to wash the pump parts with soap and water prior to using this. Technically, you should probably do what they tell you, but this is what has worked well for me: I rinse well with hot water, making sure I get all the milk off, and then use. I do this twice during the day at work and then wash the parts with soap and water each night. After 4 months of this, I haven't had any problems. These definitely save time at work, although it is a little awkward when you realize you left your bag of pump parts in the office break room microwave and some poor soul had to move them to cook their lean cuisine...oops!
