This has been the best thing I have bought. I have twin boys both with different head sizes & used it for the both of them. They hate water in their eyes and do not like to be laid back for us to rinse their hair. One of my boys hated it for awhile but I found distracting them helped so he'll keep it on. Over time it does slightly stretch (a lot of it was mainly because of their different head sizes) but if you pour the water slow enough & not just dump it it works just fine & it's not stretched to where it is unusable. I recommend this product to every parent. I actually purchased 2 more in different colors so I can have one for both of them.
