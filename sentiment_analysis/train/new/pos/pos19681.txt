Swaddling our daughter helps calm her down when she’s fussy and it is amazing how much better she sleeps when swaddled (even still now that she’s 11 weeks old).  We swaddle her every night and for every nap.  These blankets  are on the expensive side – much more than the flannel receiving blankets you see in stores - but they’re well worth the investment if you ask me.  If you don’t care about the design or color too much, certain colors and patterns are reduced prices at random times (and there are TONS of patterns and colors to choose from).  They’re very well-made.  What makes these swaddling blankets so great is their size (they’re huge at 42”) and their shape – they’re SQUARE!  It’s impossible to find square swaddling blankets in stores, and square makes it so much easier to do a proper swaddle.  We bought the Summer Infant SwaddleMe and the Halo Sleepsack Swaddle, which work with velcro, but it didn’t take long before she was able to break out of those, so many went unused.  We found doing a swaddle the old fashioned way was the most effective and longest lasting.The only other comparable swaddling blanket we found in the stores was the Aden & Anais muslin blankets – they were less expensive and just as large, but they were such a light fabric that our daughter broke out of the swaddle and had the blanket over her face (which scared me to death because of SIDS) in no time.  The thickness of the flannel fabric makes it more difficult to break out of.  The large size of this blanket will also be great in the future when our daughter is old enough to have a loose blanket in her bed with her – it’ll be a long time before she outgrows this blanket.
