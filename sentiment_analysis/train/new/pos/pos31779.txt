I read some criticisms and I agree that some of the plugs initially leaked and had to be fixed by my husband (not a big deal). It's absolutely something the company could improve upon.The real bonus of this tub is that when baby pees, there is an opportunity for it to flow out through the drains.  There are many drains on the tub and at various depths.  Once I lather up the baby, I unplug the bottom drain and rinse him completely, the replug if he wants to play in clean water.  This feature is wonderful, as with my previous tub I was forever trying to get the soap off of him and wondering just how much of the tub had pee in it.  With the "flowing" tub, I feel much more confident that the baby is clean, and soap free after his bath.  Another thing is that he really likes the flowing water.The thermometer works well, so long as you don't drench it.  It could be sealed/contained better.  I once doused it and then had to dry it for days, and it ultimately resurrected itself, thankfully.  Bottom line, don't run your water over the thermometer, but the sensor.  This requires you to keep the pressure low, so as not to have it splash all over the thermometer area either.  It is best to dry this tub upside down with the thermometer on the top end, so as not to drain INto the thermometer area.I love the concept, I use the tub exclusively....although I think there could absolutely be improvements made to it - I would still buy it again.
