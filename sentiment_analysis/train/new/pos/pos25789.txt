I have found that all suction cup toys lose suction eventually. These last as long or longer than the others I have. They are on the "good suction" end of the spectrum.  I have not found the paint easily wears off.  My baby likes playing with these on his highchair and we bring them with us on plane trips to attach to the fold down tray table so that his toys don't keep falling on the floor of the air plane.  These were definitely worth the money. 4 stars only because it is true they can lose suction (try wetting the cup first) but all of them do that, and these last longer than some others I have.
