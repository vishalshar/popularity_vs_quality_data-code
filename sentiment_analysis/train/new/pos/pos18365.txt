The maximum weight is quite an important piece of information, I'm not sure why it was left off of EVERY website's description - I spent an hour searching the web for it.  I finally decided to order the scale since I get free returns for a year.  I'm glad I did since the max weight is 100 lbs (highest of all the infant/toddler scales I believe) and so far I'm pretty happy with it.  I found I get the most accurate reading placing the scale on the floor, but I haven't tried it on a sturdy table (with a LOT of room) yet.  It was extremely close to the doctor's scale so I would say it's quite accurate.  Overall I'm quite happy with it - now hopefully with my review others will be able to find the max weight without spending hours searching!  Someone should really fix that Amazon...
