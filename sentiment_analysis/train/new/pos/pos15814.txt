My nephew, the finicky eater, is so enamored with this set that he actually asks my sister what he's having for dinner that night in anticipation of putting it on "his police car"! Part of the appeal of course comes from the fact that his Dad is an officer, and so of course he's fascinated by all things "cop"....but in all seriousness this silly plate set has turned mealtimes around for him.  In fact, when he dropped and broke it by accident last week, my sister reported that they'd had to order a replacement and have it rushed, as a certain someone was devastated by the loss of his favorite plate and couldn't be convinced to eat without it.  So on that note....beware!  (And just to be clear, this is not an easily breakable plate, my sister says that it was a freak accident where the plate slipped off of a high shelf and landed on the stone floor at a very weird angle).
