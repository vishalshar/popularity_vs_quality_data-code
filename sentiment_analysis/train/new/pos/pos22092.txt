These are actually great.  My 2 year old son drives me crazy with water bottles.  He refuses to let me hold it while he takes a sip.  He wants to hold it and carry it and eventually, spill it.  So, I went online looking for a solution and came across this product.  I ordered it and to my surprise, it works great.  I haven't had any problems fitting it to various brands of water bottles and it's yet to leak.  Luckily, my son hasn't made any issue about it being on either.  He's just happy with the fact that he's holding the water bottle!  I've already told my friends who have small children, about these. Only complaint...it takes alot of muscle to put the product on, which causes some water to shoot out of it if you're not careful.  A small negative I'm willing to take among all the positives!
