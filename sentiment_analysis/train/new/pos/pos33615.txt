Warms wipes to a perfect temperature for cool mornings and Freeezzzzing cold winter nights.Before I bought this our mornings started like this...diaper off room temp wet wipe to the warm baby booty his lil arms n legs shot straight out n the Screams can wake the deadDoesn't dry them out for at least 8 days. Im still using it without any problems almost 2 years now. My grandson Really appreciates the Lack of Shock from the freezing cold feel of a wipe pulled from a room temp bag of wipes. Durable since his birth it has been transported tossed in trunks and banged around in 3 states. Still works like new. Love it! I would give this product 7 Stars if I could. Light weight not bulky either. Only draw back it only holds enough for a days number of changes but I can live with that
