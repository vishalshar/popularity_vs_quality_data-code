Our son absolutely adores his pig and lion harness! He will wear them around the house and I just tuck the leash into the backpack part. He also loves to nap with them at times. The one drawback I will throw out there is that, I wouldn't say these are really a "backpack". There is literally zero room for anything in the "backpack" section, except for perhaps the smallest prepackaged juicy snack. Be that as it may, we purchase these items for the ability to let him roam with a sense of independence while us parents still having the safety of the connection to him in case we were in a crowd, or in case our son took off running and we couldn't keep up because we are disabled vets with injuries that hinder quick mobility. For this, it has more than lived up to our expectations!
