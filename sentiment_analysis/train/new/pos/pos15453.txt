We live outside the US in a country that is very dry almost all year round and use the humidifier with a transformer.  We have had it running constantly since we received it two weeks ago.  We ordered the replacement filters from LearningCurve.com and use filtered tap water.  It is a simple, easy to use humidifier and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with dry air.  We bought it mainly because we were having trouble sleeping because the air is so dry. It definitely makes a difference.
