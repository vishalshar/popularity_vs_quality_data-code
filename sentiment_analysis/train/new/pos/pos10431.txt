I've tried quite a few binkies and MAMs are hands down the best.  What I liked about this particular offering is that I could pick the design which I could not do with other sellers.  This style is nice because it is gender neutral and when I ordered the pacifers, I wasn't sure what my baby would be when he was born (he has since been born and is a boy).  The designs are whimsical yet understated..all in all, I'm glad I ordered this.
