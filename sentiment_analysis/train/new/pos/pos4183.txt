Within the first 48 hours after my son was born, I suffered nipple trauma from a shallow latch that the lactation consultant didn't catch. I suffered for 2.5 weeks with searing pain when my son nursed on the side that was traumatized and it just wasn't healing. I eventually started using a nipple shield on that side just to allow the nipple to heal, and while the pain went away, the crack was as big as ever and still not healing (but it wasn't infected either!) no matter how much Lanolin nipple cream I used, gel pads, and allowing them as much exposure to air as possible.After reading the reviews, I ordered a pair of the Ekstra wool nursing pads and within two days the nipple crack healed! I suffered for nearly a month with it, and if I had known about these pads sooner I would have bought them before delivering and packing them in my hospital bag! I cannot recommend this product enough!!!
