I have twins, and keeping up with who got what medicine or had a diaper change when would have been IMPOSSIBLE in the early days. This is a must-have for moms of twins, and possibly any new mother! It was nice to be able to have a timer go off to tell me to go check on the girls in the middle of the night, rather than wait for them to wake up crying. With two, it's nice to plan ahead for when they will be hungry, or need a diaper change or anything, really! I even used the * button for my painkillers as a reminder. I was able to stay ahead of the pain from my c-section, even when I was asleep. The timer would go off, I'd take medicine and be back to sleep in less than a minute. YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!
