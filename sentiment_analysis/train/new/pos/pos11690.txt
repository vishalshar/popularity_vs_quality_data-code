UPDATE:We have now used these wipes for about 2 of the last 3 years and are now on our second child with them.  Through MANY washings, and a lot of use, they are still going strong.  They are still soft, wipe well, and absorb great.  Very happy with these wipes and would buy them again in a heart beat.Original review:We have been using these wipes for about a year now and don't have any complaints.  They didn't shrink much upon first wash.  The stitching is still strong after one year (I think we have only had one little string we have had to cut off).  How you use the wipes, what the solution is, and how you clean and dry them WILL make a difference...it has nothing to do with the wipe, it's how you use them!Some things we have learned:- Putting the wipes in a container with your wipe solution and ringing them out just before use has been best for us - no absorption issues that way (we use hot water, a natural and scent/dye free liquid soap, and a little bit of oil - we prefer the oil vs. no oil because it seems to wipe smoother and easier)- Make sure you change your wipe solution out at least once a week or else you may run into a myriad of issues (mold, stiffness, etc.)- If you use baby oil or essential oils in your wipe solution, it may decrease absorption (same with cloth diapers)- If you line dry, the wipes do get "crunchy" or rough over time.  We simply throw them in the dryer about once a month and they are nice and fluffy again (same goes for many cloth diapers)- When line drying, we give them a snap before hanging and that helps keep them straight/flat - we have never had an issue with folding or curlingThe wipes have worked great for travel for us as well.  We put them in a wipe sized wet bag, rung out but not completely.  Overall, the wipes have been great, and you can't beat the price.  Most of these tips will be the same for any kind of cloth wipe.  Don't hate on the wipe...learn proper usage and care!
