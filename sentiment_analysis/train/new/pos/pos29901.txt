I love this stroller! I did a lot of research in my search for a lightweight stroller that we could keep in the car and use for travel.  In the end I was choosing between the Maclaren Triumph and the Combi Twin Sport.  Very happy I chose the Combi mainly because it has one bar handle, which makes it easy to steer one-handed and it stands up on it's own when folded, which makes it easy to store, load into the car, etc. It seems pretty sturdy and the seats have nice cushioning.Don't expect this stroller to be great on grass or rough terrain - it is not meant for that.  But the wheels are a good size and ride easily on sidewalks, inside, and we even tried it with a bit of snow on the ground.My only complaint is the canopy -  a bit skimpy and does not cover much.
