I've seen many UNFAIR bad reviews on this product because it is so small and takes several of them to line an adult-sized bathtub. This is not what the product is designed for! It is designed to go in a kitchen sink or a small baby basin. For that purpose, this product is great! If you are looking for something for a baby to use in a full-sized bath tub, you are looking at the wrong product.
