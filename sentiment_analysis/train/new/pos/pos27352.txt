I decided to go all out for my daughter's 1st birthday party last night.  I had ladybug party hats, streamers, plates, cut-outs, decorations and lots of red and black stuff.  This mat and high chair banner were some of the top decorations I had.  They looked adorable.  I liked that she had a bib to wear while going crazy with her smash cake.  It was well worth the money I spent!  I am planning to continue to use the mat under her high chair for the next while as it looks lots cuter than our plastic we used to have.
