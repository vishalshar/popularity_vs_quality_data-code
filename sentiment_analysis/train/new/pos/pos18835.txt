Our daughter is two years old and we were looking for a play mat which we could use for her playroom that provided support in case of a fall and protect the hardwood floor from scratches. Here is my rather thorough review:Packaging :I ordered the product and it was delivered promptly and in pristine condition. The product is oversized but the box and carton looked durable - at least enough to handle being repeatedly walked on by a 2 year old JAssembly:The playmat comes with 16 interlocking pieces designed to make a large square mat that is just over 4x4 feet.  The assembly took a total of 3 minutes and I was even able to make a game out of it with my daughter who enjoyed interlocking all the separate pieces.Material:The playmat is very kid friendly and soft to the touch, yet sturdy enough to handle constant jumping by children and heavy objects. The foam material comes in 4 different colors and is the perfect material for the intended use of the product creating a soft base for creative play.Customer support:This is our third purchase of a Tadpole product in the past 2 years. Before I bought this product I had some questions on the material and customer support answered them quickly and effectively which ultimately led to my purchase. Good customer support is important to me.Price:The average parent knows that they can easily spend $50 - $100 on this type of product. The Tadpole Square playmat set was appropriately priced at $25, making this an easy and quick decision for me and my wife.Overall assessment:The mat works exactly as advertised and is easy to assemble and clean. I also like the bonus benefit that my daughter can mix and match the circles, learning how to manipulate objects to fit them together. It's a bit like a giant puzzle for her. I would definitely recommend this product to other people.
