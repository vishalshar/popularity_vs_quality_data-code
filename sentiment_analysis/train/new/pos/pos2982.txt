this pillow is great.  it makes tandem nursing possible.  the pillow is angled toward the mother so it makes it very easy to nurse both babies at one time.  it's even easy to burp one baby while the other one continues to nurse.  i would recommend this to anyone having twins and planning to nurse.  sometimes i will nurse one and bottle feed the other one while they both lay on the pillow.  my husband has also used it to bottle feed both of them at once.  i had a breastfriend pillow to nurse my first son and i loved it but this is a must have for nursing mothers of twins!!
