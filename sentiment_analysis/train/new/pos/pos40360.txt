Our 5 month old Nicu Graduate loves this thing. She would rather sleep in this than her crib, and bad mother that I am, she has slept in this overnight. The motion is gentle, but if you do some research you will find that the motion of some swings to children is the equivalent of an adult on a amusement park ride. No wonder they quiet down, they are scared! Not so with this one. She feels like I am holding her which allows me to either a.) get some sleep or b.) get some housework done. She was born premature and her corrected age is a little over a month. I put her in the upright position so she can see the tv or a soother and she has no problem with falling forward. I tuck a blanket under her shoulders and around her sides to keep her from leaning to far to one side. (She is only 6lbs) The speakers on this are the same as any other baby product. They play the music. No this is not an ihome or bose system. Get over it. You didn't buy this to make your music sound better, this is for baby. We would not be a happy family without this thing.
