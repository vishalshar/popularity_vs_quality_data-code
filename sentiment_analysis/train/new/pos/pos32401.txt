Even at the ages of 4 and 2, my kids still love playing with these beads!  They call them "pop beads," and my two year old will come up to me holding them and saying, "pop pop!"  It's a simple enough toy that it really lets your children's imaginations run wild: we have made necklaces, crowns, bracelets, choo-choo trains, jewels, practically anything with them.  And since there are 20 pieces, they're a good opportunity to teach sharing.  Good lessons in color names and counting as well.  The bucket is also surprisingly fun, as younger children love to dump things out and put things back in.  The lid is frustrating for my oldest, as she doesn't yet quite have the strength/coordination to unscrew the top, so she freaks out a little and brings it to me to open, but once that lid is off we have a blast.
