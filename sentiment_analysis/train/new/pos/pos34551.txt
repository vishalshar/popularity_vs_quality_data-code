Carters has a very good product here. I'm sorry to see they have discontinued it. Baby's love to chew on everything and the silk binding seems to always be a favorite. The light weight and soft texture is perfect for a baby to  drag around and as a warm wrap when carrying them. We found one in a discount store and after using it for several months purchased two more through Amazon as backups for when the first one eventually gets worn out from washings and handling. The monkey was on all three but the "going banana's" saying was missing from the one we purchased at the discount store and was on only one of the two we received through Amazon.
