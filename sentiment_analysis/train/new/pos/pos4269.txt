Reading previous reviews, I can see that this product is a little controversial!  I think it's great for several reasons.  Yes, we know that it is ok to drink in "moderation" while breastfeeding.  However, moderation means something different to everyone.  Many moms would just like the peace of mind of knowing that their milkd is 100% clear of alcohol.  Also, it allows you to know how long to wait until pumping.  I don't want to pump any milk that has alcohol in it, just to be safe.  So I can wait until I get a clear test and then pump away!  Finally, I think this product allows moms to feel like they can relax a little.  First time moms are so nervous about everything and want to do what is best for their baby - usually sacrificing their own interests for this cause.  That is great, but everyone needs to relax sometimes and for me, having a drink on date night allows me to unwind and recoup for the next week - and now I can do it GUILT FREE!  I highly recommend this product and really appreciate the women who came up with it.  Hopefully they can come up with strips for things like dairy in the future!
