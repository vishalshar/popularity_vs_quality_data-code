My baby loves this!  I gave it to him when he was 5 months old, started rubbing his cheek with it and putting it in his hand to help him nap.  Now at 6 months he searches for it with his hand to help him go to sleep!  It's very soft, perfect size for a baby (about washcloth size) and safe. My son does love to munch on the trunk and it washes up well.  I'm considering ordering another!!!  The only thing I don't like about it is that it looks more like a rat than an elephant in person (not quite as cute as the picture) but honestly my son doesn't care.
