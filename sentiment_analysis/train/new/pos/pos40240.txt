The rest of the item is lovely, the bag is roomy and all the zippers work fine (I'm using it as a purse actually.)It took me all of two minutes to peel off the label from the wipes case, cut the border off and the misprinted Bay Snooby, and stick the adorable little puppy Snoopy graphic back in place. I now have the wipes case being used for pens and pencils, but you can easily return it back to its original use. Or just leave the graphic off entirely if you want to.Seriously this is nothing to kill the rating on an otherwise really nice product.
