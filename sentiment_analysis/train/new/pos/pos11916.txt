I looked everywhere for a cover that would fit BJs, Costco and the new Target carts and actually completely cover any area that my kids could grab or chomp at. It was impossible to tell from reviews and half of them were pretty old. After purchasing 2 different covers that did half the job they were intended to I finally found this seat and decided it give it a try. I am so happy I did!This cover not only fits the absolute largest shopping carts out there, it also fits all the high hairs I have encountered. It stores neatly into itself in the form of a bag and is super easy to toss in the wash.I would have saved a ton of money and time had I just bought this one first.
