Purchasing this extra base was worth every penny.  These bases are tricky to install correctly and it was nice to know that once we had it in there we didn't have to wrestle with moving it back and forth between vehicles.  Just click the carrier in and we were on our way.  Also especially nice because our daughter was a fall baby.  I would not have wanted to spend 10 minutes outside during a Michigan winter trying to move the base around, nor would I have wanted to have only had a convertible carseat.  The Snugride carrier and base in the way to go!
