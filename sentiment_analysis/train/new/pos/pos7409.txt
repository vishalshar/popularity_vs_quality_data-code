This is your basic messenger diaper bag. There is no structure but it is roomy. I like the insulated pockets inside and it had a little sheen for me while being neutral enough for my husband. The inside is like a burnt orange, I have seen people call it hunting orange and straight red. Ours was definitely a burnt orange. Nothing fancy, does the job.
