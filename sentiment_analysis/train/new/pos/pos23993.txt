The box came quickly and was well packaged, but I was surprised a bit to see that there weren't any written directions or package contents included inside the box. What was inside my package, in addition to the complete and assembled gate:- 2 pairs of different sized clamps that screw in to attach to your sliding glass door- 1 pair of rectangular headed screws that screw into the other side to cushion the gate into the jam of the door- 1 silver "door stop" that prevents the sliding glass door from being moved out of the clamps.It's all fairly self explanatory, but it would have been a little helpful to get a materials list just so I knew that everything was there for sure.Other than that, it works just fine with my apartment sliding glass door. I'm waiting to see if the clamps scratch the paint after a while but will keep using it.  The connector is easy for big people to undo.  My little guy isn't quite at the point to try and figure it out yet but I think motor-wise it would also be difficult for toddlers to push the button to unlatch it.
