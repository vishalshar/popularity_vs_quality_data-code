I do like that this item has a removable/ washable cover.  My active baby has maneuvered the cover off the seat while in it though, a minor irritation.  It is adjustable, which is nice, but only for 2 settings.  My other booster has 3 seat height adjustments.  The item does fold up nicely for portability, except that you have to carry the tray separately, a bit annoying.  The tray is dishwasher safe, great.  However, I wish this was a snap-on tray, like my other booster.  The slide-on tray makes me nervous with my daughter's flailing arms constantly in the way.  Overall a good product, but I prefer my Fisher Price one.
