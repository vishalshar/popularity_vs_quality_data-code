I love these bottles..this is my second baby and the second  time we have used them.  I did decide to use glass this time and love them.  You can warm your formula or breast milk up very quickly just under running water.  You will need to learn how to use this system but once you do...its no big deal.  I also am a huge supporter of Dr. Browns because he lives in my town and I trust what he has accomplished with these bottles. I will say his old bottles went up to 8 oz on the big ones and 4 oz on the small ones (which these do not..7 and 3)  so that makes things difficult b/c of how formula is scooped out but again minimal effort involved.  Another issue is that the glass bottles leak...I figured out that after you shake your bottle and warm it under the water..just simply loosen the lid again and allow the milk to run back out of the tube and into the bottle.  Takes a second, but I have learned this does prevent the milk from dripping on your babys neck..Hope that helps people:)
