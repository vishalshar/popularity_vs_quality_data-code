We've had the 2010 City Select stroller since my son was born..4 years later we still love this stroller to pieces!!!!!! Our stroller has been through everything and it still works as nicely as the first day we got it. Let me start out by saying that I'm very heavy handed and break things easily. My husband wanted me to have a stroller that could take my abuse. Well...4 years of opening, closing, throwing in my trunk, and it still works like a charm. We moved into a condo a few years back and I can't tell you how handy this stroller has become. I've hauled groceries in this for years (not just 2 little bags, I'm talking 6 plus bags of heavy groceries and items from Costco ) up to our condo. The basket is a dream......very large and sturdy. The sun visor is very large and blocks everything. The telescope handle is also very handy when going into tight elevators and when someone shorter pushes my stroller. The recline positions are awesome... I think there are 4 different positions. Another thing I love is when I'm clothes shopping, I can hang a good number of items on the handle without the stroller falling over. Again.. It is VERY sturdy!!! This is the only large stroller you need. Thank you Baby Jogger...the City Select has given us many happy years and still more to come!!
