Bought it to match the crib set. The first one that arrived had a screw sticking out the base where it missed the post for the lamp. Hey, that's what returns are for and they are pretty painless on amazon. New one works great. I gave it a four because the description says dimmable but I don't see how. Maybe with a special bulb I guess.
