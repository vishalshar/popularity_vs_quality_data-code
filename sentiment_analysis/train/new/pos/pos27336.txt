Being an automotive enthusiast, the fact that Recaro made child safety seats in addition to full-fledged race car seats was pretty exciting to me. Then I found out this seat was continually on the Insurance Institutes Highway Safety (IIHS.org) "best bets" list for booster seats, coupled with the very reasonable price, and it was a no-brainer for me.The seat itself is well-constructed with high-quality fabrics. It's one of the best looking booster seats I've seen (can't believe this is actually something I keep track of...), and it seems to offer excellent protection all around for my little ones. Some reviewers have complained about the large wings around the child's head (SIP system); however, the wings have never affected or bothered either of my kids, and they actually help support their head when they fall asleep in their seat (which happens quite often on longer car rides).Both my kids began using one of these when they were about 3-3.5 years old and 40-ish pounds. The fit is great, and because the headrest/wings can extend up, it will grow with them as they grow. The way the seat belts work with the seats is pretty straightforward, although it can be a little difficult for kids under 4 to buckle their own seat belt properly (you'll at least want to check it before driving away). The seats are easy to get in and out of cars (of course, probably not as easy as bottom-only boosters - but these offer much greater protection), and I have two of them in the back seat of a 2-door coupe with no issues.We liked them so much we bought a set for my wife's minivan as well, so between the 2 cars we have 4 of them (2 carbon, 2 black/tan). Given Recaro's racing heritage, and the fine quality with which these seats seem to be constructed, I expect to have these seats until both my little ones are big enough to no longer need them. I definitely would recommend them to anyone, automotive enthusiast or otherwise, looking to move from a regular car seat to a booster.
