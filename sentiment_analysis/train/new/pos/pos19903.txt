LOVE! Though my son doesn't care for it as much as I do lol. But he hated tummy time for a long time and then one day he just came out of it because he realized he can see everything and explore around while on his tummy. Though he has mixed ways of transportation, mix of army-crawls and rolling over, I would throw him on here and this started helping him get into the right position to do more of a crawl so that was pretty cool. Im sure when he's a lil further along he'll be more into it. At this point he is just interested in crawling and climbing everything he possibly can and getting into anything that isn't for babies and that I put down on the floor for him---He wants everything else besides that lol. But he has leaned toward it a couple times and I think he will be more into it one day very soon! Love mamas and papas. If I knew the brand b4 Noah came home I probably would've spent 100s of dollars on stuff that Noah would hardly useâ€¦They really are perfectly fine w.pots, pans,spatulas & water bottles!--Update 2/12/17My son did start to love it more & then after he was running around he liked to play with it, He turned 2 11/22/16 and he still plays with it... & Now we are expecting baby boy #2 by April 4th. Only issue with this thing is that it's a b- to clean & does is a link magnet. like u have to really sit there & pull everything off of it. This really stinks that it's not really truly washable. I had 5 stars, I'm going to say 4 now because of that but really I'd say 3 stars just because that is such a crappie issue & disappointing... But it rele was the main thing that got my son in the right position to crawl.. & it didn't take long. A few times on this and he figured it out n started taking off.
