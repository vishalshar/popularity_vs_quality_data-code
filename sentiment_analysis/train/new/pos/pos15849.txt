This hutch is definitely worth the price!!! It is a beautiful piece that will be used for many years, not only as baby furniture, but as a bookshelf and storage cabinet for toys, clothes, etc. There is ample storage and is very effective at keeping things within hands reach and organized during changings and just in general. I would recommend this to anyone, but there are a few things that I wish I would have known before buying it.1. My biggest complaint is the color. I have antique cherry furniture and modern cherry furniture, and this cherry hutch does not match any of my other cherry pieces.  It has a deep purple hue to it, closer to an eggplant color. There are many different colors of cherry, but if you are looking for something closer to Brazilian cherry hardwood floor, this is NOT going to match.2. The doors, drawer fronts, and several trim pieces are the only solid wood pieces. The rest is veneered particle board. That being said, this piece was engineered very well. It does not feel flimsy like other particleboard furniture I have purchased and assembled. For example, the drawer bottoms are set into dadoes, not just nailed to the bottom of the drawers.3.  The drawer slide rollers do not line up well with the predrilled holes on the bottom of the drawers, and strip out easily with even a little too much pressure. Solution is to predrill your own holes for the drawer slides and use extreme caution when tightening the screws.4. If the tower is used and attached to the hutch, the standard size changing pad does NOT fit properly. The lower shelf of the tower has to be left off as well.Overall, we are very satisfied with this furniture.
