My daughter was making the move to a big girl bed from her crib to prepare for her new little sister. I wanted to make her toddler bed fun for her so it would help with the transition. Unfortunately, almost all toddler bedding sets are crazy expensive, and a lot are not even cute. This one was perfect since it was affordable and she loves Tinkerbell. She got soooo excited to see Tinkerbell on her pillow and blanket. The sheets fit perfectly on the mattress, even with a mattress pad on. I love that the top sheet is fitted on the bottom. My little squirmer has yet to pull it off because of that feature. The comforter is light, but still warm. It's a good all weather type of blanket. She prefers a warmer room to sleep, so I keep a small space heater for her. Together the space heater and comforter keep her plenty warm. The quality was great too. The sheets were soft, well sewn, and nothing has loose threads anywhere. I am quite picky about the bedding I use for my daughter, but I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
