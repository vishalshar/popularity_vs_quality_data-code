This is really cute and goes great with the rest of the Champ Snoopy theme!  It's a little small, but I'm able to fit size 1 and 2 diapers three accross.  I have't tried size 3 and up yet.  I also washed it first.  I actually like the size and am not disappointed with that.  But if you want something larger, check the dimensions.  The only thing is that is heavy when filled and the hanger is plastic.  I am going to look into trying to find a wood hanger to make it more sturdy.  Other than that, it's a great addition to the theme!  Super cute!
