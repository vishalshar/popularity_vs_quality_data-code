This has been great! Both my husband and I can use it. I am 6'0" and 145 pounds and my husband is 6'4" and about 240 and is very muscular and both of us are able to use it. We used it when our baby was about a month, but it didn't support his head as much as we liked. We tried it again at 2 months and it was still the same thing, but a little better. By 3 months however, we could turn him so he could face out and look and it was great. He is 6 months now and still uses it. It has a nice feature where you slide a zipper and select the range of age so that they will fit perfect in it. We use it a lot for things like shopping. It is nice cause when he was 3 months we started to notice a flat spot on the back of his head so this came in handy to keep him off his back during the day. This one also has good padding for your shoulders.
