Prices must be changing on Amazon because I got these for under $12 a two pack and that was good for me because they are the only bibs that work.  They are so easy to wipe and dry pretty fast.  My 21 month old can't tear it off her neck because of the back snaps and there are three holes for adjustment.  Also that large crumb catcher catches so much!!!  So food doesn't fall on her pants or the chair.  I love love these.  This is the second two pack I get bc I now leave a couple at grandma's or for my diaper bag.  I have stopped using any other bibs because they seriously pale in comparison and I can't be bothered!!!  These are a godsend!
