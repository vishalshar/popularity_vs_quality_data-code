Bought this for our Baby Trend Sit and Stand double stroller. The back sun visor is useless (one of very few complaints for that stroller) Anyway, these shades are AWESOME! I think the girls will be way more comfortable out and about this summer. Very easy to put on and remove, I kept the plastic package for storage. Adds incredible coverage. It's currently very windy and the babies haven't budged.
