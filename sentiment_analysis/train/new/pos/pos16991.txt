I bought this wireless camera because we have our crib up stairs and the stairs are very squeeky. So now we can check and see if he's sleeping without waking him up by walking up the stairs. My wife and I both use the Seedonk app on our iphones and it works great!! (We already had audio baby monitors in there so the no audio doesn't bother me)
