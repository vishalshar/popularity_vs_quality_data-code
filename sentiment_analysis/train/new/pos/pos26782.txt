Cannot say enough about "Pie"  Purchased this for my daughter when she was 4 months and she hasn't let it out of her sight and she is now 8 months.  She enjoys chewing on Pie's face and feet the most.  The little spots on the cheeks are raised so feel good on her gums.  Has a soft squeak that she enjoys as well as the bobble head effect.  I was concerned about the little "ears" coming off, but after 4 months of serious non stop use they are still firmly attached.  Definitely worth every penny!
