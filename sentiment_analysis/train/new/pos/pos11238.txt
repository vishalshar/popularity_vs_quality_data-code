I bought these glasses in April 2010 based on the favorable reviews here in Amazon.  The glasses were only used lightly, but the silver colored Bolle logo on the left temple arm fell off recently.  The logo has been glued into the sun glass and there is a light greenish / yellowish tinge where the glue was applied.  I may be speculating, but it looks like the glue starting giving away after coming in contact with sweat.Even though the sun glass itself is fine, it is unusable due to the missing logo.  Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I'm not too happy that there could be such poor quality control.  Now I have to look for another pair of sun glasses due to this.*UPDATE* June 2012:  I was out looking for sunglasses in Amazon.com and I remembered about my earlier purchase of this sunglass.  On a whim, I contacted Bushnell customer support (who own the Bolle brand) and the customer service representative offered to ship a free replacement sunglass to my residential address in Singapore!  I'm impressed by Bushnell's customer service since they are shipping me a free replacement all the way to Singapore even though I originally purchased the sunglass in US and is past the warranty period.  Hence I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars.  Now I wait for the replacement sunglass to reach me!
