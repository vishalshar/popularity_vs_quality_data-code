I bought this when it first came out, mostly for the vibrating seat.  At about 5-6 weeks old we put on the lights and music arch (it is detachable) that baby can activate with his feet..well, my son figured this out pronto, to my and my husbands amazement.  When he sees us pull it out know (8 weeks) his whole face lights up and he goes to town with his feet hitting those buttons.  He will even hit the buttons when the arch isn't attached (a kind of demand for it I think).  This has been the best purchase we have made so far.
