I just purchased this for my 6 month old and that's the only thing that I can think... How did I ever live with out this??? I had a Graco Quattro before, and purchasing this stroller has brought me out of the dark ages. That's how drastic the difference is. (And I loved my Quattro...I thought that I'd never trade it in.)I'd like to address a few things that people have said. First, "The shopping basket is to small." Yes, it is a LOT smaller then the baskets that you would find on normal size strollers... But that would be b/c this is a smaller stroller. You can't put a HUGE basket under there. It just wouldn't fit. For the size of the stroller, the basket is an alright size. As far as the tipping backwards if you put to many bags on the back of it. It's a no brainer. Yes, I could put more bags on my Quattro, but it was a bigger, heavier, wider stroller, I could add more weight to it. This weighs next to nothing... You add weight and somethings gonna happen.Second, "It's difficult to fold." I haven't had any issues with folding it. It's rather simple, you just push down on 2 things with your foot and push it down. It's not that hard. I can do it while holding my wiggly 6 month old in my arms.Third, "Maclaren customer service is non-exsistent." I have had no issues with them. I received my stroller and the basket had a small hole in it. I called them up, faxed in a copy of my receipt and a week later I had a new basket at my door. It was that easy.Knowing now, what I didn't know before I had my daughter.... I would have just bought this stroller right off the bat instead of wasting my money on the big bulky stroller that goes with the car seat. It was like driving an old car with no power steering and then driving a car with power steering. That's how much better the handling is. I wouldn't waste my money on another stroller.
