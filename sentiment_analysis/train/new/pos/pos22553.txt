We purchased this two years ago for our daughters bike and here's the deal:YES it is somewhat flimsy and cheap and probably should cost about $10. YES it does move around when she rides and has her doll in it.But here's the thing - our daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES it. Her American Girl doll accompanies us on every bike ride (she actually wants a seat that can hold TWO dolls....).And it has lasted 2 years.So - four stars for the delight it gives our daughter, three stars for product quality - but was totally worth the purchase.
