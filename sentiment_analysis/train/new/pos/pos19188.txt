These are my favorite bibs.  I give them to all my new mommy friends.  One day while at church I saw a baby in front of me with this bib on.  It covered her cute church outfit, shoulders, and caught all the dribble from her bottle.  With a 4 month old, I immediately went home and started searching for this item.  I ordered two when I found it online.  The material is very soft and there is no scratchy material around the neck to agitate the baby's skin. It catches milk and drool and protects those cute outfits you put baby in.  It even protects my nice clothes when I am holding her.
