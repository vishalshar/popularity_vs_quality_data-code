I have a few other sets of velvety sheets for my kids' beds and this one is by far the softest and thickest. I love it, will probably order 2 more sets so I can always have one on each baby's bed. The other brands I have are from Carters and JC Penney, they are soft but don't even compare to this one. My son has very sensitive skin this is nice and soft for him, perfect!
