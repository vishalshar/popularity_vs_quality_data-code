At our old house the Boon frog was held up by the adhesive strips it came with, & there were NO problems with it. Once we moved, I couldn't decide where exactly I wanted to mount the frog in the bathroom, so I didn't want to commit to heavy duty adhesives or, especially, the screw wall mount option. So I decided to try this suction cup bracket. We've had it for over 2 years now &, honestly, it only fell down a couple of times, which is WAY less than I expected. It works great for us. & I can move it to any spot I want whenever I want without much work at all. Too bad the company discontinued making these. I would buy more once the suction becomes weaker on my current one (which is totally normal & expected with time).
