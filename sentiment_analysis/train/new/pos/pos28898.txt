With the purchase of the FAA-Approved harness system for toddlers/children, we wanted to do away with the bulk of lugging the carseat through the airport. We found that even with gate-checking a car seat, it can get pretty banged up and abused in transit. For our most recent trip (round-trip, one connection each way), we used this Car Seat Travel Bag and found it to be a nice way to check in the car seat along with our other luggage. After a couple of practice runs, getting our big seat into and out of the bag was easy. The side zip pocket was perfect for stashing some car window shades and the strap (for check in). So far, in our limited use, the bag seems quite sturdy and the strap makes the heavy car seat "sling-able" for short walks.
