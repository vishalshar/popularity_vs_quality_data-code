Pros:  A nice quality piece of furniture - the wood, finish and construction all appear to be superior to our old wooden high chair.  Our daughter finds it very comfortable as the seat is well designed.  It has the best chair pad I've seen, it wears and washes well, and so nice to know it does not contain harmful materials like other chair's pads- no vinyl,pthalates, etc.  Tray is adequately sized for a toddler and easy to clean and remove once you get the hang of it.  It is nice that the tray cover is one-piece construction unlike our old high chair which had parts on the underside that were a pain to clean.Cons: The tray setup is problematic since the tray positions are very limited by the design of the tray- still, we easily solved this problem by removing the front underside tray bracket so we could push the tray in more so that food wouldn't end up on our baby's lap. Only other con is that while the nice felt pads on the chair base are great for protecting floors and for easily sliding the chair, they are not so easy to keep clean if they get wet from baby spilling food/drink.
