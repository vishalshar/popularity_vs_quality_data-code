I read through most of the reviews before I decided to buy, which made me worry about the rust spots and broken lids. But I still want to give it a try after my 1 year and half boy break the third ceramic bowl.I am glad the whole set of tableware is as good as I expect. No rust spots, no broken lids. The shells are easy to separate from the bowls/cup/box. The sizes are perfect for my baby's relatively small high-chair table. I like to put rice in a bowl , and vegetable or meat in another bowl or plate.This set of bowls is just right for me. If you like to put everything in a big divided plate, you might think every piece of this set is tiny. They are easy to clean since they don't absorb odor form food or dishwashing detergent like plastic bowls do.
