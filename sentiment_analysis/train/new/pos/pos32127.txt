I really like this double stroller! Love it for easy maneuvering in small spaces and it's as light with both my kids as one. Only downfall is not a lot of room on bottom for child sitting there and it doesn't close real well with 2nd attachment. Even though I still think this is the best double stroller I could of purchased and not having to be bulky and heavy!
