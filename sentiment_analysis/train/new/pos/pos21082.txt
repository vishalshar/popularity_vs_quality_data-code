It does take up a lot of space, but my 3 1/2 month old loves it.  She can stand and jump in it for 20 minutes at a time.  She likes the jumping better than the toys on it, but she does reach for the toys.  I think it's a little much for her yet to jump and play with the toys, as the toys are a little bit out of her reach.  As she gets older, the toys on it might be more useful.
