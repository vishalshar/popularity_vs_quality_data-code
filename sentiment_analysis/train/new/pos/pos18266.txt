Like most new moms I did a LOT of research before buying a stroller and I'm so glad I landed on this one.  It is the perfect combination of comfort, light weight, portability, durability, functionality and style.  The most important thing for me was weight and easy of in and out of the trunk.  Check.  It's super light without being anywhere NEAR flimsy like other "umbrella strollers".  With a flick of the finger and a step of the foot it folds and unfolds like magic and is a one hand lift in and out of the trunk.  The wheels are VERY tough and durable and can handle rougher terrain than more umbrella strollers as well without getting all dinged up.  It's SUPER easy to clean, the mesh basket in the bottom is big and well designed, the handles are comfy and don't fall apart, the straps are easy to adjust, the cup holder is awesome and doesn't get in the way (and fits my iphone) and the retractable sun shade is perfect.  I can't say enough about this stroller.  It's the only one you will need!  My husband and I and our son all love it.  FYI we're both around 5'7" and it's the perfect height.
