This gets the bottle very nice and warm without being too hot for my baby. It works well each and every time if you know what to expect. Here's what to expect- 1. It will take 30min so plan ahead. 2. It will keep it warm for up to 3 hours in the sleeve so you have some leeway on when to click it hot (click the button early!) 3. If you drop it or it is in a bag getting bounced around, it might click on accidentally. It's not the end of the world because it will keep the bottle warm until the baby is hungry. 4. You have to boil it in hot water for 15 min each time after you use it to reset it.I have the Prince Lionheart and this one. The advantage of the Price Lionheart is that there is a handle with velcro that keeps the handle together so you can hang it on the stroller or hold it easily. The Dex cover is more malleable and I prefer this one but my nanny prefers the Prince Lionheart cover. The heating mechanism is a different shape too. The Prince Lionheart has a circular part that goes under the bottle but yet it is not as long as the Dex. All in all, the heating mechanism on this and the Prince Lionheart one works about the same.
