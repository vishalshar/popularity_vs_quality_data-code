I purchased this travel case with fear b/c some people complained their strollers were damaged. We recently traveled to CA from FL and I'm beyond glad in purchased the case. It fit the Cameleon3 stroller with extra room (I packed diapers, wipes, blankets with it). Due to previous comments read, I asked the baggage checkers to put "FRAGILE" on my bag which they did without any problems. My case and stroller were in perfect condition when I received it. So happy I purchased this case.My husband was not too excited about spending so much $ on the case but even he commented how great the case is and that it was worth the $.
