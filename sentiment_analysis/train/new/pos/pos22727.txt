I can say that I am so incredibly happy with this chair! I just love it. I have boughten multiple "cheaper" chairs for my two year old and they have just gotten trashed in no time. Toddler wear & tear is real! The struggle is real! Since we have had this chair it has had a whole cup of milk, whole cup of water, poop, food and God knows what else on it. The first time a cup of milk was spilled on it I was for sure it was garbage. But I used a dry rag and soaked the milk up and then a damp one to just go over it and now you can't even tell it was there. This chair holds no stains whatsoever. I absolutely love it. My son does to. He sits in it everyday and has a snack or plays his games. It is so soft and comfy. I would absolutely recommend this chair. I plan on buying the matching couch very soon. We are very pleased. Disclosure: I bought this chair at full price. As always all opinions are 100% my own.
