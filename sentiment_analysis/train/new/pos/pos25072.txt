I was on the fence about buying these bags because a lot of people say they leak.  Read reviews on all bags and you'll find at least a handful of people who swear every single one leaks.I have NEVER had a leak that was not my own fault.  They stand up great on their own, so freezing them is really easy.  After they're frozen, I store them in a big plastic food container with the bottom layer open-side-up and the top layer open-side-down.  No oozing.  I always thaw them in a bowl of warm water.  The only leaking I have experienced has come from the zippy part and not because of a malfunction.  I've gotten some milk in the zipper before putting it in the freezer, I think as it freezes, it expands and pushes apart the zipper a little bit.  Obviously my fault, not the bag.  They are really easy to zip, too, so improper zipping is difficult.  Double-layered, so the chances of real problems are slim.Criticisms:They are pretty small and the ounces on the bag definitely don't correspond to any real measurement.  Even when I'm sure to fully expand the bottom, it always reads way more than I actually put in the bag.  They say they hold 5oz, but putting 4oz in brings them to the 5oz level.  I pump into the bottles that came with my Medela pump and then pour into the bag.  If the number of ounces is really that important to you, do it this way and write on the bag how many oz are really in there.The holes for pumping into the bags directly are super annoying!  The first time I thawed milk and was pouring it into a bottle, I wasn't thinking, squeezed the sides and just poured...right over the part with the holes.  Milk everywhere.  Again, my fault.I have never tried pumping directly into the bag.
