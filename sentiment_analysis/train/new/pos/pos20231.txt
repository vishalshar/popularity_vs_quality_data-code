This worked so well in our Jeep Grand Cherokee that two months later I ordered another one for a second vehicle, which isn't a Jeep. It doesn't matter because it was just as easy to install (it took literally 30 seconds) and provides a good view of what our four month old is up to (or confirm that he's still sleeping, like now).
