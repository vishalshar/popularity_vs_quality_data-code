Had a larger sized high chair with my first. Got rid of it to buy a hook on high chair. Since that didn't work with our table, we bought the Graco Contempo. We do not have a lot of space and needed something to fold up flat. This high chair did the job. Relatively easy to open and close and fold up,. The fabric seems easy to wipe up messes. I like that there was an extra cover included. My son (6 months and small for his age) fit perfectly, the other high chair we had did not fit my daughter until she was almost 9 months old! My only concern is that the actual seat part (where their bottom goes) is a bit narrow and I wonder if he will outgrow it sooner, but right now it's perfect. Our kitchen table is actually counter height and I don't feel that he is too low to be part of family dinner. So far so good!
