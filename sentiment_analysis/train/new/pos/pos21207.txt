My husband and I love these stickers.Pros:I really needed something to jazz up the wall over my crib, but I didn't want anything that could fall on the baby, problem solved.They stick really well, and we did have to remove and reapply a few times to get the look we wanted.I have very textured wood paneled walls and the texturing of the stickers help make them stand out.Finding a growth chart in feet/inches proved to be a challenge. Don't get tricked like I did with all the other stickers, this one really is in feet.Leaves are numerous and free floating allowing you to position them where you need a little bit of color.The knots (are separate stickers) did an excellent job of connecting the vines. It took a little trial and error, but if you put it at a good tilt it makes the whole thing look so 'real'.Cons:I would have preferred a screen shot of the stickers pre-wall, The monkeys require a little bit of assembly. In the end it works out because you can customize the tails and feet positioning, but it make it a bit complicated to find the perfect fit. My husband is on the fence about whether this is a con, but I didn't like it.
