I purchased 11 of these timers to use as baby shower favors.Presentation:  The timer comes in a plastic box with a ribbon and card, exactly as pictured.  While the timer does not feel substantial (made of plastic), it does look nice and is well presented.Size:  The base of the timer measures just under 3 inches (2-15/16").Material:  The timer is made of plastic.  4 of 11 timers came with the upper "teapot" part detached from the timer base but the two parts were easily connected securely by pressing them together.Packaging: Each boxed timer came wrapped in plastic so the ribbon and card were not damaged in shipping.Function:  Because of the reviews of the timer not ringing, I tested all 11.  There is a sticker at the bottom of each timer that reads, “To set timer, turn past the 15-minute mark, then to the desired setting.”  Following that instruction, all 11 rang.  I do have to note that not all of them rang at the appropriate mark.  9 of 11 were good or acceptable, ringing at or close to zero (a little early or late but very close).  I returned 2 of 11 because one consistently rang at the 2-min mark and the other rang at the 1-min mark.I also wanted to see if the timers would work without turning past the 15-minute mark, as instructed.  So, I tested them using progressively longer time intervals.  All of them rang when set to 6 minutes or more (a few at 5 minutes or more).OVERALL:  Given its intended use, the look, presentation and function make this a 4-star product for me.  I took one star off for poor quality control.  I would recommend this product to others but I would suggest ordering well in advance to leave enough time to test and exchange as needed.
