This bedding set it ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! Bought this for my little girl last year and I received everything as stated in the post and it was all just so beautiful!! Everything fit the baby bed as it should as well as all the little extras that came with it. The bumpers that came with the set I really liked because they are full and fluffy so they do as they should in keeping them from bumping the sides. The diaper hanger is beautiful as well as the little items made to hand on the walls. Very good quality material, love the minky dot and it's very soft! The pink a the beautiful dark pink but not too dark and not too light. We incorporated all the colors and designs into her room from her bedding! You have the option to have the pillows monogrammed that come with it and we did and if was just as beautiful as everything else! We always get the bedding first then design around that! The skirt was a little long for her bed but it doesn't bother me at all because it looks beautiful that way as well. I always get so many compliments on her bedding because where I live you can't go out and just buy something like this anywhere! Very well worth the money and it wan't that expensive either!!
