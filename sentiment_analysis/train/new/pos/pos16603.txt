Great educational toy! Lots of vibrant colors, different textures and activities all in one plush cube! There is a ball that you can put into a hole (ball is conncected by a string so that it doesn't get lost).  Although my three month old doesn't know much yet, she loves tracking the object with her eyes. She loves all the vibrant colors and rattle noise and squeals with delight whenever I hold it in front of her. I can't wait to see how much more she will enjoy this toy as she gets older and gains more motor skills. This toy should be able to entertain her at least until two years old..there's just so much to do on there. It is small enough to take with you but large enough so that there are a lot of details on the cube. The cube has a plastic ring on it to practice gripping. There is also a flap with velcro on it to teach your infant to open and close (learn cause and effect). Overall, a wonderful purchase!
