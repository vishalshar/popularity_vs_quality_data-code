I always try to read the ratings on a purchase before buying it and I was a bit hesitant to go through with this one because of all of the negative reviews on the baby bumper and quilt.  Many people have said it was too thin--on the contrary they were perfect, as was the rest of the the order.  I think the problem is that some people don't read the washing instructions through before putting it through the washing machine and flattened their bumpers, quilts and pillows.  As long as you do it properly they're really quite good. The order also got here a day early which was wonderful because I procrastinated in buying it and expected to get it after my sister's baby shower--she got to open it with her other presents though, and was so pleased! Well done!
