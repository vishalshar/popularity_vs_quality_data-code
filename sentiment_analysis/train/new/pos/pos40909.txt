I get annoyed with reviews that don't tell me what I need to know, so I will attempt to cover details that I find important!We bought this booster for our 8.5 yr old granddaughter.  She is approx 50 inches tall, and weighs 48-50 lbs.  Our car is a 2004 Toyota Camry 4-dr sedan.  My husband says the latch installation was very easy.We wanted to position her in the center of the back seat for safety purposes.  But these details should apply just fine to the outer seats as well.  The latch system, for me, is a must!  While it isn't as tightly secure as a regular carseat for smaller/younger children, it fits solidly, with just a little movement.  It won't fly around the car when not in use, and provides more security in the event of an accident.  The color (Sailor) is a dark charcoal, and what I would call a "dusty" turquoise.My granddaughter says it is comfortable, and easy for her to buckle herself in.  What I like a LOT is the seatbelt guide strap, which I don't think anyone has mentioned, and is not in the video, or product description!  And, for me, this is an important feature!  I was concerned that, with the center seat positioning, the shoulder part of the seatbelt would cut her across the neck.  But, with the seatbelt guide strap (included), that is not an issue at all, and is easily adjustable to the most comfortable position for your child.  The seat padding isn't very thick, although I'm not sure ANY brand of booster seat would be any more plush.  I imagine, for longer trips, you could always tuck a towel underneath?  The cup holder is fixed.  The arm rests are fixed, and are not padded.  And my granddaughter really likes the storage drawer, which pulls in and out.
