I'm usually very picky when it comes to organizing and record keeping, so I wanted a baby book for our first child that suited my needs. After reading multiple reviews for baby books, I decided to purchase this one and one other. I love this book! It has everything that I was looking for in a baby book. Along with cute designs, it contains multiple pages for pictures, firsts, and places to write information about what happened before baby was born. At the end, it also includes a place for mommy and daddy to write a letter to baby boy. Adorable!
