I used this for a trip recently and I this was a perfect help! I could keep my baby's bottles in one clean place and not even make my host's kitchen look cluttered with all sorts of baby stuff! I did get about 4 bottles to dry on the rack, it was tight but when travelling it was well worth it.The brush stands very conveniently in the little spot for parking it. I also carried the nipple cleaner that comes with the Munchkin set (link below). That fit very well in the box as well when I closed it.http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Bottle-Nipple-Brush-Girl/dp/B008KIQ6MK/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1429798884&sr=8-7&keywords=baby+bottle+brush
