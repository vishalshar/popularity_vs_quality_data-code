This is by far one of the best! The mirror is large enough to be visible from just about anywhere. The reflection is a real one, not a carnival mirror reflection. The music is soothing for my daughter, and the fact that there are two volume levels is great. And I love the light! She just sits in her seat and stares at herself. And try popping around the seat and surprising you kiddo when momma or poppa show up in the mirror!
