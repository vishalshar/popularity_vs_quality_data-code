I absolutely love this car seat!! The Graco Snugride 35 LX Click Connect car seat. I couldn't tell you how many hours/days I spent searching for the best car seat/stroller. I looked at Britax, Chicco and Baby Trend and I finally found the perfect one! I recently bought the Graco Modes Click Connect stroller and I absolutely love that one. So I knew I had to get a click connect Graco stroller to go with it. I was in between the regular Graco Snugride 35 Click Connect and the Graco Snugride 40 click connect.I felt like the regular Snugride 35 didn't have the padding I was looking for, for my baby. I loved the light weight though!The Snugride 40 had the perfect padding, but was quite a bit heavier than the 35. I also don't plan on keep my child in a car seat until he/she is 2 years old. Once my child is too heavy to be carried in a car seat carrier, I will switch him/her to a regular convertible car seat. So I didn't see the need in spending $220+ on a car seat only going to be used until 1 year IF that.I finally came across the Snugride 35 LX and it was perfect! Had the padding I wanted, weight was in between the regular 35 and 40. And the easy adjust harness was an added bonus! NO RETHREADING!!I definitely recommend this to ANYONE!!
