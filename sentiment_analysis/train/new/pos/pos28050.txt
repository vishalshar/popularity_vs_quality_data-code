I didn't know the difference between the single burpy bib for $10 and the 2 pack for $22, so of course I opted for the 'better deal'. I have since learned the 2 pack is actually the higher quality and larger burpy bib, while the single bib is made cheaper for target etc. Same is true for the blankets. The higher priced are the better quality. This single burpy bib is still nice and larger than most other burp cloths and bibs so I will still get much good use out of it. I like it very much, but next time will go for the 2 pack.
