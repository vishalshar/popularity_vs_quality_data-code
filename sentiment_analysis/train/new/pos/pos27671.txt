I breastfed my older daughter so I had no clue about formula when we adopted our second daughter.  The nurses at the hospital said, "Oh, you have to get a formula holder cup and then you turn the dial and easily dump it into bottles you've already got filled with water.  That'll make your life easier."  So we took their advice and bought the Munchkin one that the grocery store had on hand, but it was terrible!  The formula static-clung to the sides and within a couple of uses we were ready to chuck it across the room.Then I took a chance on this Piyo Piyo one because it had three containers and that funnel, and WE LOVE IT.  It's a perfect fit for getting formula into narrow-neck bottles.  It's very convenient to have the sections filled and waiting.  I can even screw the funnel on one-handed while holding the baby in the other, which is really important when out and about.The only possible down side is that if it's at all humid or you don't dry it thoroughly after cleaning, the formula can start to stick in a thin layer that builds up.  But it's only a problem if you leave it a long time between washes, which you probably shouldn't do anyway.  It definitely is perfectly fine for several uses between washes even in humidity, and longer in dry times.Seriously, this thing is a real boon to formula feeders.  You need one.  I'm so glad we have this.
