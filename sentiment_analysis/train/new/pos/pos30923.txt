We purchased this for our 5 year-old daughter and she LOVES it.  She even kisses little piggy's nose.  It's very cute and even has her initial (S) on the pink bow on top.  Pay close attention to the size - we think it's the perfect size to put on her dresser but it is just a bit larger than the typical bank.  I think this would make a wonderful baby shower gift - so unique and baby won't outgrow it in a month!
