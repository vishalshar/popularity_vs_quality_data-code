I love this necklace.  It keeps my baby from pinching me while in a carrier, and still lets her practice using her pincher grasp.  It looks good enough and has enough variation in size and shape that other people don't instantly identify it as a teething necklace.  It also instantly draws baby's attention (other people's babies have also started biting it the minute I started holding them).The two drawbacks are the breakaway snap starts coming apart far too easy after being pulled away, and that it is only for supervised play (choking hazard).  The latter doesn't really bother me because that was not its purpose.
