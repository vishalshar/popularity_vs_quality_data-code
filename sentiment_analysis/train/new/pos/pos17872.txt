I absolutely love these sleepsacks. I have purchased both the 100% cotton (for the warmer months) and the fleece type my little one. Both types are soft and wash up great. I line dry (rather than put them in the dryer) and they look new after numerous washes.  They are easy to get the baby in and out of and even easier to access for a quick diaper change.  A great way to keep your baby safely warm after he/she is out of the swaddle stage. This is such a great product; I plan on buying the footed version when my child starts walking. If you are on the fence about trying them... do not hesitate - go for it!
