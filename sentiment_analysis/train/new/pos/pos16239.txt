Incredibly cute hat for a baby. It runs big, but that just means baby can wear it for longer; who doesn't like that?! Will fit next season, too! :)The pins it comes with are strange, and not high quality, so we just tossed them. The hat itself is super. Wash before wearing; yarn is just a bit stiff.
