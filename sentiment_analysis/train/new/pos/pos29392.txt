I have this sleep sack and several cotton halo brand sacks. This sleepsack is quite thin like a tshirt. Thus even over footed jammies I worry about her being cold particularly given that the parents are under a comforter. It means that we keep the bedroom warmer than is comfortable for us (about69). The solid color halo sacks are a thicker cotton fir which I think 67 degrees is ok when over footed jammies.However the zipper design on the summer sack is far superior. It zips both ways. Thus you can zip it all the way open top to bottom to get baby in or out or you can unzip just the bottom for a diaper change or to keep baby cool in the early warm part of evening (I like to leave the bottom open and then zip it later when the room cools off, without waking baby) . And you don't have to thread thezipper. With halo you have to "start " thezipper like on a sweatshirt which can be hard in low light with a wriggling baby. Halo does allowopen the bottom forndiaper change.
