We have been using this for 6 weeks now with no big problems.  I am dinging it one star because of two minor disappointments and one aesthetic irritation.  1) I didn't have trouble installing the wheels as other people have mentioned, but they aren't particularly good at rolling--they're a bit stiff.  I do wish the wheels worked better (mostly for moving back and forth to soothe back to sleep in the middle of the night).  2) For some reason, I thought that this would swing a bit more like a hammock (again for soothing purposes).  Not so, but my assumption and not something they claimed.  3) This last is minor, but might bug some people:  the stickers indicating which part is which (A, B, C, etc.) are really hard to get off.  We've ended up leaving most of them on.  It's in our bedroom and in use for a short period of time so it's not a big deal.Since these things are not a big deal to me and this was a much better price than similar bassinet set-ups available and we will be using the bassinet for just about 3 months, I am overall very happy with the bassinet.I do not see what the reviewers talking about mattress stability are talking about.  The bassinet comes with a board that you are supposed to insert into the mattress cover to make a stiff backing.  I thought, in fact, that it was so stiff that I have added a mattress pad to make it more comfortable.  The velour sheet that comes with it is very soft and has held up well in the laundry.  I purchased a couple of additional ones but the one that comes with it is the nicest one we have.
