Having twins on the way, I was in the market for 2 mattresses, so budget was limited.  Lots of research and store visits to find the best mattress, sub $100.  Very happy with the firmness and support of this mattress.  As other posters have mentioned, it's firm, but not rock hard like some firm mattresses.  It is interesting to note, and maybe this happened to some reviewers who said it was too soft, but if you feel the mattresses standing up it feels softer than when it is lying on the ground.  Lying on the ground gives the mattresses the full support and there is a noticeable difference in the perception of firmness.My only concern, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, the mild vinyl smell coming from the mattress once removed from it's plastic bag.  I'm having twins, so I get the pleasure of comparing 2 of everything, and both mattresses have this smell.  If this dissipates over the next week, I'll update with an additional star because it seems like a great mattress.  However, as a product designer, it boggles my mind how you market green certifications and a baby mattress, but select materials that smell when 1st pulled from the package and therefore needlessly cause me to question if I'm harming my newborns. Even if this is harmless and does dissipate over time, it seems counter-intuitive to the perception you're trying to give parents of a super-safe product for a new baby.Note on construction spring vs. foam.  I opted for spring because my 2 year-old has a spring and it has held up very well over the years.  While never trying foam, I was worried about the potential indentations over time and their ability to hold up, especially at the cheaper price points, but have no basis for that belief except for the varying reviews I've found online...
