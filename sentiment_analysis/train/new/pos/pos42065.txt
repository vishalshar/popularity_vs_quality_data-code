I just returned from a 2-week trip to Serbia to visit relatives.  I bought the Jeep Travel Anywhere 2-in-1 just before we left for the trip.  This is the one item I will never leave home without!  It's so versatile and extremely useful.In the bag I was able to fit a big ziplock bag with 8 diapers, a thick pack of wipes, a pack of kleenex, a change of clothes, a few toys and some snacks, plus a silicone table mat that we use in restaurants.  On the pockets on the outside, I fit a magazine for me and 2 bottles.The seat is sturdy and fits on any chair as the straps are very adjustable.  My son is 1.5 years old, 30 inches tall and 28 pounds and is very active.  I found the booster seat to be perfect for him.  Of course I wouldn't leave him unattended in the seat, but I had no worries about the security of the seat.We used it the entire trip - I used it as my diaper bag on the plane, in the airport between flights at the restaurant and took it along wherever we went on our trip.  It was amazing and I don't know what I would have done without it.  It's great because it integrates the diaper bag and booster seat so you have 1 item to carry.I highly recommend it to anyone!
