We use these all the time, and they are easy for my 7-month-old daughter to hold and feed herself.  I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher, and they may benefit from an occasional oiling, but so far they are holding up great.Addendum: my daughter is now close to 9 months.  She outgrew these wooden spoons very quickly, and we haven't used them for almost a month.  Now she is using the spoon from NUK Gerber BPA Free Graduates Kiddy Cutlery Set, 3 Pack, Colors May Vary, which holds more food, is easier for her to hold, and goes in the dishwasher.  So if your baby is little, go for the wooden spoons, but for an older baby I would recommend going straight to the bigger and sturdier kiddy cutlery.
