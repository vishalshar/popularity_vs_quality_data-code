Since I am Grandma, it seems to most always land on me to handle the needs of my Babies. Yep...you name it....school clothes, birthday parties, winter clothes, summer clothes paying the bulk of the car payment for them because the Babies need to be in a reliable vehicle and have all the safety features they all need to have...then grow out of them  and then I have to get the next one and the next one and having said all that...love this carseat!  Ha ha ha ha ...yep...I am Santa, Mother Time, Cupid, Easter Bunny, fireworks maniac, wicked witch and of course the Family Turkey!!  Have a good day!!
