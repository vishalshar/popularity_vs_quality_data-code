This is a great pail.  I love the opening sensor feature and the space for dumping the diaper is so big you could fit two diapers at once.  The battery last a long time (have used it for 6 months now and havent had to change the battery).  The only thing you have to change every 1 or 1 1/2 month is the filter, otherwise you can start smelling close to the unit.  I have an older kid and wished I knew about this pail then.  Compared to other ones (diaper champ and the one with the fan option) this is a good option for the price and features.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a good deal - for the smells, you can always get the bags that control odors.
