We use two of these side-by-side in the crib and that covers the entire middle area, where our boy sleeps most of the time.  We have had to remove them for washing when we've had dirty diaper blowouts or he's peed through a cloth diaper.  They are extremely useful in protecting the mattress and cover, so we love them.  Unfortunately, we find that the strings on them are too short, so it makes tying them extremely challenging, especially for the side of the crib that is up against the wall.  My wife, who is tall for a woman, can't tie the strings on the far side of the crib that is against the wall and has to wait for me to get home to tie it.  Even then, when I tie it, it is not even close to being easy.  If you have a crib that is not up against a wall or is easily moved, then the struggle to tie it is not nearly as bad, though, the strings are still too short.  Unfortunately, after washing and hang drying, we experienced significant shrinkage, so now the strings are even shorter.  It would be awesome if they could sell this cover pre-shrunk.
