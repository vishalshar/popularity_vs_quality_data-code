Although the Wendy Bellissimo line came out too late for us, I am already planning turning my son's nursery into a double for the next child. The Wendy Bellissimo line corresponds well with our Pottery Barn Kids bedding, and the colors I chose for my son's nursery which is how it got my interest. The quality of the fabric in person is beautiful, soft, and rich. Those who gave it low ratings have instead suggested some very low quality bedding that, quite frankly, does not compare on any level. And the fact that many of the items are slipcovered is a huge plus. My PBK bumpers are not. I contacted the Wendy Bellissimo company to find out what they were using different in the bedding to bring the prices down. They responded saying that this is the same fabric and bedding that was sold under the Bellissimo line before, but because of a partnership with BRU are able to sell it at a much lower price. Obviously, this is true in any case. You're going to make more selling at a mass retailer at an affordable price, than at a boutique not many can afford. This being said, lets face that this isn't the same very custom bedding that she did for top celebrities, and isn't using velvet in her BRU collections! I, a very particular shopper, plan on considering this line for my next child's bedding, and am looking forward to the Moses Basket, and the rugs that I've heard will be coming out. I hope this helps clear up some of the quality issues some people are having.
