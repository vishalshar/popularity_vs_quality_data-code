I'm writing this review a little late but I have to say, I absolutely loved this chair from day one!  I never heard of the Inglesina brand before purchasing this chair, I bought it based on reviews and comparisons to other big name brands.  The day I pulled it out and started using it, my husband was a little wary of its stability and security.  We were first time parents so of course he would be worried!  After the first use at our counter at home, he immediately saw how safe and secure my daughter was sitting in the chair.  Granted, we never tried another brand, but this chair is well made.  Its attached by turning and tightening the handles under the table/counter until the chair is taught.  After using this chair, we immediately started investigating other products made by Inglesina and we are in love with the products the produce.  We started bringing it out with us to restaurants and when they would ask if we needed a high chair it was nice to be able to decline and use our own.  We always had onlookers and stares.  Probably from those that thought it didn't look safe and from those that thought the thing was cool!  It definitely has a cool factor and my daughter loved being elevated so she could eat on the table rather than have to reach for her food at the table.  Its also very easy to clean!  I'm sure there is a way to unfasten everything and throw it in the wash however I haven't quite figured that out.  I just use a wet cloth and scrub it down if its dirty and the stains are instantly gone!  We are on our second child now and although we don't go out to eat much anymore, its stationed permanently on our counter and the baby eats in the chair while older sister gets to sit like a big girl on the counter stool.  It must be the fabric and materials but it still looks brand spanking new after a good wipe down!  It gets used on a daily basis in our home.
