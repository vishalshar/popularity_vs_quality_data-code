I love the idea of the suction cup--when you put it down so the bristles are not touching the countertop.  Also, I like the little nipple brush snuggled in the handle.  The one thing I could do without is the sponge part. The sponge slides around the handle a little, and I feel like sponges hold germs more and are more difficult to keep clean than the bristles.
