Why? Because it's a total pain to keep feeding these creatures batteries, even if they're only a fraction of a penny a piece. My hedgehog's cuteness cannot be denied, so I keep him/her on my stairs doing what it does best, looking cute. As for a nightlight... meh. You will need three "one use" AG10 Alkaline batteries, currently selling on Amazon for as low as one cent per 10 pack. Pony up $1 a piece for the Silver Oxide AG10s and you'll only have to change the batteries every 5 or so days. But wait, there's more. You will need to buy one of those tiny phillips screwdrivers to access the battery compartment. That's potentially daily care and feeding for the little hedgehog and it's family of squirrels, bunnies and birdies. Best to buy a plug in night light and save the menagerie for art and special occasions.
