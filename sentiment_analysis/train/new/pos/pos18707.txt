I really like this pillow. I have not experienced the Velcro peeling sound when  I use it. the only time that happens is if the edges are being pulled apart. don't have it pulled to the max and that wont happen. The only reason I took off 1 star is that you need a commercial sized washer(ie go to a laundry mat) to wash it and the fact that it is impossible to roll over with it. but I think that is a problem with all pillows that are designed similarly. It did help me to sleep better and even by husband loves the pillow and will often snag it once I get up in the mornings.
