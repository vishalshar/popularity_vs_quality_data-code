Bath time is a happier time now because our two-year old loves to watch Pocoyo. Like all bath toys we have to be sure that the water is emptied from the toys when bath time is over...the only character that doesn't squirt water is Pato so we have to shake the water out of his 'bottom' and it's never certain we get it all out. I can only think of the biology experiment that is going on in Pato's tummy as a result...otherwise these toys are great for any fan of the TV series.
