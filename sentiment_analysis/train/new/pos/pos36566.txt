I first found these bottles for my nephew who had feeding problems. These were the only bottles that helped with his reflux, so when I found out I was expecting I couldn't wait to grab these up. I am going to nurse and the shape and feel of the nipple really helps cutting out any nipple confusion. I was very disapointed however when I had opened them and they weren't the glass bottles. I am sure it stated on the site that they weren't and the important thing is that they are BPA free BUT was a little sad none the less.
