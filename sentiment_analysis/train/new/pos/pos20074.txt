I purchased this hamper for my daughter who has a new baby boy. (I am brand new grandfather). She loves it. It holds a lot of baby's laundry and she can keep his little things separate from big people stuff and makes it a breeze for her  to do the laundry. The hamper is light, folds up when not needed and the mesh sides give the dirty things plenty of air so they do not get really smelly before washing. Buy this and you will not be disappointed.
