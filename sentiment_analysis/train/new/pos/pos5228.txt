I love this baby book! At first I wasn't quite sure if I was going to like it or not, but I do. I love the footprint/handprint accessories and the little picture album in the back! I got a Carter's baby book for my firstborn and filling out the same stuff every month was kind of silly to me. Besides, some months didn't really stand out to me, so I have some empty months. This way, I can fill out what I think will mean something to my little girl. The sheets are of good, thick quality, and the binding is very good quality as well. Lots of space for pictures. I will say, the little notes on the bottom are kind of silly, but they don't bother me much. :) All in all, VERY happy with this baby book!!
