After shopping and comparing, I found that this seemed to be the longest bassinet and best quality available for this price range. The others seemed to small and/or wobbly. This one is very sturdy. I find that the wheels aren't that helpful since its on carpet and I don't ever move it. I just end up stubbing my toes on them when it's dark. One helpful tip is make sure you have the motion mechanism set to"On" rather than "demo" mode. I felt silly after I realized why it was only rocking for a few seconds at a time the whole first month I was using it. Also, the other reviews mention the mattress is kind of thin. I agree so I lined it with a thick soft blanket and my little guy loves it.
