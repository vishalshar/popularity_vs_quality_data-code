For all the people saying these are dangerous because "nothing should go between the carseat and the seat", I am interested to know if any testing was shown that this is dangerous. My theory is that a manufacturer would say this solely because they have not tested it, rather than having tested and found negative issues. This thing is super thin and has a sticky surface. My Radian seat base is much more stable with this in place and since we are still rear facing it doubles as a kick mat. I am generally pretty paranoid regarding safety related items for my kid, but unless someone finds actual test results showing that carseats are less effective with this installed, I am going to go with common sense on this one.
