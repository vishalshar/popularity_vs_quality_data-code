I purchased these solely to use to wipe my son's messy face after eating.  I had been using regular wipes and they were breaking his face out.  I had tried another brand of reusable wipes that were very thin and I wasn't happy with them.  These are a good thickness and extremely soft.  Great for messy faces!
