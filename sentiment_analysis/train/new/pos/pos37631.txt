I purchased this 7 months ago. Ive liked it. Lots of pockets. Easy to carry. The bigger bag is perfect for all the necessities and I carry food for both baby and my 5 year old in it. You can't beat the 20$ price tag. But the dual zippers are already kinda broken. I don't understand why they put dual zippers on diaper bags. It doesn't clean well either. We had a spill in it and its outside drying off after a thorough hose rinse down. I can't get the black wear and tear marks off the outside either with soap or cleaner. We'll see if it recovers. Im beginning to think it might have been worth it just to buy a more expensive one. 7 months for a diaper bag just isn't worth it.
