I love this stroller! When we first put it together, I was a little worried because it seemed longer than I expected. But after using it, I was very impressed with how well it handles. Even with both of my kids in the stroller, I didn't think it felt heavy or hard to push at all! I have a 3 year old who is 40 pounds, a 21-month-old who is 32 pounds, and I am 7 months pregnant, so if I can push the two of them around, I would think anyone could. At one point, I had to tip it back to get up one step onto the sidewalk, and it worked just fine. Anymore than that would have been difficult, but that would probably be the same for any double stroller. Yes, the front seat is a little small, but it's designed for a young child. I wouldn't expect my 3 year old to fit up front when it is the back seat that is designed for the older toddler. Nor would I expect to fit a 5 or 6 year old in the back very well unless they're small for their age. My son had no complaints and seemed quite comfortable. If you are following the specifications for age and weight, I'm sure it will work just fine. It folds up nicely to fit in the back of our SUV, and then it's roughly the same size and weight as our previous stroller (a Graco Glider). Overall, I think this was the perfect choice for us.
