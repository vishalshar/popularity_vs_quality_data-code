I purchased this front pack when my baby was about one month old to go on walks with. I saw it in a baby magazine listed in the top ten for baby carriers and the price was much cheaper compared to the others. I had a wrap and a sling, but they didn't seem as supportive and felt a little awkward. This carrier is so comfortable and easy to use, especcially when you are by yourself, and my newborn loves it. When he's fussy, this puts him to sleep! I used it all summer long to go on hikes, walks, and do yard work. I also used it to cart my little one around at weddings. I highly recommend this for the price and comfort!
