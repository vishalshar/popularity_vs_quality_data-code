This walker is very easy to put together. It doesn't need any tools to assemble it, just to open the battery compartment (small flat head screwdriver). The instructions are clear and easy to follow.The walker itself looks cheap but actually I was surprised how sturdy it is once put together. I do have to say that the washable seat for this is a little tough snapping into place so I won't want to remove it much to wash it... still that is a small price to pay for safety.the front wheels are casters which rotate in a complete 360. the back wheels jsut go forward or backwards... this is a safety feature, as are the traction strips on the underside of the walker. The baby will only be able to move backwards at first, but with a little time, s/he will be cruising all over.I am a little concerned about the activity toys on the tray. From the reviews, it looks like baby may bang her mouth a little. If that is the case, it will take me 2 minutes to detatch the toys and save it for later when she has more control. Also, the sound for the toys is actually not bad. Most toys have 2 volume settings; loud and louder... this one (in my opinion)actually has 2 real volue conrols... soft and medium.Still If I ever get annoyed at the noise, I can turn it off by flipping the switch... or just let the battery run out.the worst part of the whole thing is adjsuting it to different height levels... I found it easier to turn the walker upside down and adjsut it that way... still, my thumbs will be bruised for days for all the pressure it took to adjust.Hope this helps... definately worth the $40!
