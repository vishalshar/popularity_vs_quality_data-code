I babysit for my grandson occassionally and found it awkward to handle all the little dishes required when he started on solid foods.  By the time the cereal was warm, the vegetable was cold, etc.  I remembered from raising my own 3 kids these great dishes that held hot water to keep the food warm.  Works good.  I fill the dish with really hot water, let it sit for 5+ minutes and then add the warm food.  Stays warm for the entire meal, which can be rather lengthy with little guy's hands in his mouth all the time!  This is especially nice using with the food grinder and your own home cooked food.  Keeps the food warm while you are all eating the same meal!  I bought 2, one for me and one for my son to use.
