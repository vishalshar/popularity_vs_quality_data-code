My son is 4 yrs old and out of diapers but I still need a big bag for our adventures. This is a perfect fit for me! There are so many pockets to store everything I could possibly need. I even have empty ones!Great quality, beautiful material and print. I love the different strap options. Yes, I like to have a choice if we're going to the zoo then shoulder strap, just the store then handles which still are large enough to fit over my shoulder & hang at comfortable length.The key hook is a lifesaver since I'm always just holding them. The changing pad will be used too when we got out to the park or zoo as a table top picnic cover - it's very large!My wallet and cell phone fit in the front pockets - I read a review before purchasing this that a wallet wouldn't fit in the front pockets because they are too small. I find that to be amusing. How big is your wallet? Mine is a little too large and it fits with room to spare.Aldo love the feet pads on the bottom of bag. Helps protect it a bit from wear.
