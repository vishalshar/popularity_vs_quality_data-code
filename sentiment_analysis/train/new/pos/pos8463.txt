These are perfect for little hands! Got these for breastmilk popsicles for my 5 1/2 month old and they are the perfect size! They seem to be made well and don't have a cheap feeling at all. The popsicle wells take about 1/2 an oz of breastmilk or less, so they don't get too big for her mouth. Would definitely recommend! Don't mind her face in the pic, she wasn't crazy about the cold but she did eat the whole thing and it kept her occupied for a good 15 min!
