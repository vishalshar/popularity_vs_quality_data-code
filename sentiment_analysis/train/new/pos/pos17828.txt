I use FuzziBunz with my son and I hate how the inner liner pad does not fit snug leaving room for...well urine to seep through. These diapers are my go to for nighttime because he is a belly sleeper and that 'room for error' isn't there. They keep him dry AND they are a ton easier to button these on vs. the fuzzibunz one size elite which are snug on my 27pd boy.If there were not as  bulky I'd use them under his clothes in the day but they would never fit under most pants.
