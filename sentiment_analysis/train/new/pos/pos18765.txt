I have never bothered to write a review before, but in this case I feel compelled. I have 3 daughters and own almost every type of carrier that exists, including the front carrier, the sling, the backpack thing, the side hip thing, you name it. I was forever in search of the perfect, every-scenario, comfortable-yet-practical carrier. I found it in this one. My youngest is 7 months old and - no kidding - has been in this wrap every single day since she was one week old. First of all, it's the most comfortable carrier you'll ever wear. The soft t-shirt type material does not create a single pressure point, the babies weight (mine is about 16 lbs)gets evenly distributed, and there is absolutely no back ache like with other carriers. It's versatile. As an infant they are cradled inside in a lying down or diagonal position, then, upright and facing in. Later, as with my baby, on the side hip position. They can also face out or ride on your back. All this with the same tie, which, I might add at this time, is not complicated once you do it 2 or 3 times. it takes about 20 seconds to get on. When baby is in it, they feel the same thing they felt in the womb - weightlessness, warmth, and the familiar pattern of your everyday movements. They are either quietly alert or asleep. On the outside, it looks like you're wearing a little cozy cocoon. You can nurse with it on. I take my baby to work and I wore her constantly as an infant while having my hands free. now she crawls around but gets in the wrap when she is tired or fussy and it's instant gratification for both of us. Not a day goes by when I'm not approached on the street by strangers asking about this wrap. I thought I had to spread the word even more. Makes a terrific baby gift. You will not regret this purchase.
