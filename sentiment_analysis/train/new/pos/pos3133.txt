I purchased these to use as diaper wipes in my electric wipes warmer.  Since we already use cloth diapers, I figured we might as well use cloth wipes also, and not waste money and resources on disposable!In researching cloth wipes, I quickly found that there are tons of (pricey!!) options. I had decided to just sew my own from scraps--and I was not looking forward to the tedious and time-consuming task--when I found these little washcloths! Perfect!These are thin enough and perfectly textured for diaper duty. They are just a smidge too big to fit nicely in the warmer, but it's hardly worth mentioning.  I bought 3 doz, because there's nothing worse than reaching into an empty box!I fold them in half, wet them with plain hot water, then stack them in the wipes warmer, all ready to go. Some of the hems have been damaged by the Velcro on my diapers, but otherwise they are holding up nicely. About the only issue is their propensity to stretch out of shape, which makes it slightly frustrating to keep them neatly folded in half.
