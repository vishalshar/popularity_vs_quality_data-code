It's ironic to me that these have an average rating of three stars. If you look through you will see a lot of rave reviews and a lot of bad reviews. I am fairly certain that all the bad reviews are from parents who do not understand how to get the lock off. That's how hard it is to open when you don't understand the simple, brilliant trick of it. This is a lock that still works on my superintelligent 7-year-old because he doesn't know the trick. We have had babysitters kept out of a cabinet by it too.It's an incredible design and I am disappointed that KidCo appears to have stopped making them. They should have just redesigned the packaging with better directions for the parents. If I recall, it was a little vague. People seem to think you have to push in, when you actually push DOWN on one side. Oh well....Oh, and their other qualities: They fit very securely with no chance of sliding off the knob; once you get the knack, they are very easy to open or close one-handed; and when they are not locked they hang neatly on one knob and don't get in the way. Highly recommended!
