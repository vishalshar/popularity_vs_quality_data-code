We were lucky enough not to have to try any other bottles/nipples with our little one. She immediately took to this Avent bottle. Its nice because it comes in many different sizes (we have 4 oz, 8oz, and 11oz). They are easy to clean as there are not an extreme number of parts to each bottle as well. On the up side, the wide mouth opening makes it easier to add formula to, if thats your method of feeding. My baby didn't seem to have any colic, fussiness, or gas while using these bottles. You can also buy different wide mouth nipple flow stages, 1-3, to accommate babies needs. LOVED THESE!
