I've used Gro Bags for both my children from 3 months. They are great quality and last through multiple children. There is the added benefit that children can't climb out of the cot wearing. Most can also be used in car seats. Compared to other brands I've used the Gro Bags have never had loose stitching or ripped. They are worth the cost especially if you have more then one child.
