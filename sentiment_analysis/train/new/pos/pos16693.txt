My daughter used this seat for the first time today and she loved it. I loved that she looked very comfortable and safe and when she fell asleep, her head rested on the side without hanging down like it use to. She felt very grown up and she has always stayed still in the car so I haven't had a problem like the 1st reviewer. Please read the comments attached to the first review which are very informative. I did alot of research before I purchased this seat and I'm so glad I bought it. I also like that the fabric is easy to remove and wash, my daughter gets car sick sometimes and washing the fabric to her 5-point harness carseat was like crule & unusual punishment. The fact that it folds is just gravy. I bought the bag for this carseat so I can check it on the plane without a problem. Love it, Love it, Love it!!!
