These are the ONLY sippy cups we'll use with the kids. There are so many out there that has straws and lids that don't come all the way apart. We just didn't like the idea of handing the kids a cup that couldn't be completely cleaned. With these you can easily clean them. Our oldest can open the cup for refills. Haven't had any problems with the younger babies getting them open.The spill factor is not a concern. The baby is constantly getting a hold of the older kid's cup and still can't spill anything.The price we found on here was better than anywhere else we looked. In fact, you couldn't even find these cups in some stores we were in. If they would have some it would be one color/style, which makes things interesting when you have three kids you're buying for.
