i didn't actually get to use the product because it is too short. i would not have purchased had the item description mentioned that these only work with 'mushroom shaped knobs with a stem up to .75in diameter or D-shaped handles up to 3.75in apart'. my cabinet handles are spaced 4in apart and these do not go on. this is because the 2 pieces do not come apart by design. it's a shame because it looks like a decent product.
