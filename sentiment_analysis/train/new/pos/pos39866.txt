This is my favorite infant bathtub of all time....and I've tried them all. My little guy was so comfortable in this from his first bath on.....it is soft and structured enough to let the baby relax while you can use both of your hands to bathe him. Unlike sooo many others where you end up holding them with one hand so theyou don't slip or fall forward and trying to wash and play with the other free hand, which is just the worst! This tub made bath time fun again for all of us and I think all the good experience early on helped him love bath time, which has continued to be the case. He's almost 2 now and we have another on the way so we'll be orderin good another one soon! This is also my go-to baby shower gift and every time, I get the call saying how great this tub is.The reason I can't give it five stars is bc its literally impossible to clean. Supposedly you can machine wash it but after doing so twice, mine ripped. Since it's constantly getting wet, you run into that moldy gross wet smell, which I can't take. My solution for that was to use an all-natural shower spray  (I used Method every day shower spray) to spray the tub down top and bottom before I hung it up, each and every time after use.....it's pretty heavy when wet and kind of annoying but necessary. Even doing that, I went through 2 or 3 before he was 1. Again, he was happy and comfortable, so I was happy and it was worth it!
