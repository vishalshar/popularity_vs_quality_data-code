This is a very nice Winnie the Pooh-themed universal pacifier holder. Fits about any types of pacifiers. The only gripes I have is the length of the lanyard--it is a little too short in my opinion, but works fine, in most of the cases... The greatest advantage is that it doesnâ€™t have a metallic clip, which rust pretty quickly, as we had discovered it with our previous model... Overall, I would recommend this product.
