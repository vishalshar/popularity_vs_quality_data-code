I have 30 of these for my twins and they are fantastic.  I wish I had used them with my first child as well instead of disposable.  I love that they are all in ones - I don't have time to stuff, etc.  Just throw them in the washer for two cycles and they come out great.  I don't pretreat poops or anything.  there is some staining but I haven't treated them yet to try to get stains out.  I started using them when the kids were about 10 pounds and I would get some leaks out the leg holes but they are only 11 or 12 pounds now and I don't get pee leaking.  I do get occasional poo leaks but that is because my kids only poo once every 5+ days, so when they go it is a TON and let me tell you, these hold twice as much poo as a Pampers would (I know because I have been experimenting!).  I think Pampers is the best disposable on the market and I will continue to use those when we travel, etc.Give these a shot!  They really are easy to use.
