The only reason I gave this nipple a 4 instead of a 5 is because it would likely be too fast of a flow for a breast feeding baby. It drips quite fast just by turning it upside down, which is great for cleft palate, but not so good for the average baby with normal sucking power. My son with Cleft Palate started off using a Haberman nipple, but after he became more skilled at getting milk out of the Haberman and handling a faster flow, the Doctor Brown level 2 seemed to work as efficiently. Being a soft nipple, with a fast flow, my son with a cleft palate is still able to get milk using these nipples. From 2-3 months he used the level 2 nipple, and then at 3 months the level 2 and the medium flow of the Haberman were too slow for him. The level 3 seems to work well enough that I don't need to buy any more Haberman special needs feeders. It's nice to have something that costs less than the Haberman as an option. It is also nice to not have to worry about changing the flow by rotating the bottle when feeding at night or letting someone else attempt to feed him. Though I know every child with a cleft is different, I'm glad that this has worked for my son.
