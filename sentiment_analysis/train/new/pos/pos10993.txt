These are very inexpensive compared to my other cloth diapers.  They work just as well and I don't see any problems.  I would say though that I'm not a big fan of the inserts that they come with.  Microfiber inserts just hold on to the stinky poop or strong pee smells so much more than bamboo ones (which I love). My only wish is that they came with bamboo inserts which I wouldn't mind paying a couple dollars more for that.
