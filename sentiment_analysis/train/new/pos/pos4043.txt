purchased the lifenest for my Grandaughter.  Seemed like a great product for very young child.  She was within the age range suggested for the product but was to big to fit on it properly. I thought the product was well made, but could have only been  used for a short period of time. I needed to purchase it when baby was about 1 month old.
