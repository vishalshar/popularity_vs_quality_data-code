The Safe-Er-Grip Drip Dry Portable Drying Rack by Mommy's Helper is a useful tool to keep in bathroom or laundry room.I personally have mine in my shower, my husband uses a stretchy knee brace/sleeve every other day when he jogs. It's a hand wash item, and he used to throw it over the shower curtain rod and water would drip down the front of my decorative cloth shower curtain and drive me nuts. So, I bought this. It works as it should. It has three 6 inch swiveling arms so you can have one almost dry item on one arm, and place a wet item on another arm and not worry about getting the other wet. You attach it to a wall with a suction cup. It holds VERY well. And you hang things on the arms. Very easy to install and use!The drying rack is not very big though- it's for smaller items like a wash cloth, childrens clothing, or maybe if you wanted to hang a shirt on a hanger, that would work...
