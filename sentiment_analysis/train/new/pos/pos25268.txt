Who knew . .  I purchased this little vibrating mattress "paddle" on a lark.  Nothing else has helped with my restless leg syndrome, so for $20 bucks it was worth a shot.  I have had restless leg since I was very, very young.  I am now 70.  My sleep is disrupted almost nightly by the overwhelming and undeniable urge to move my legs.. . .nothing helps.  The condition is horrible and, often, by morning I am in tears.  I read a snipped of a message on one of the RLS blogs I follow.  We are alllll searching for something to help.  The adult mattress vibrator costs in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars, which is okay,  IF it works.  But I would hate to order something that expensive and it not work, EITHER.  So, I thought I would try this little "paddle" to see if it had any validity.  OMG, it works!!!!  I do not put it under the mattress as it is too small for grown up mattress.  I just turn it on and lay it on my lower legs.  The vibration is soft and quiet but effective enough so one does not feel the urge to move your legs.  You have NO IDEA what a wonderful thing that is.  It has a 15 min. shut off.  Good thing, too, because I am usually asleep by then.  I can recommend it for RLS, highly.
