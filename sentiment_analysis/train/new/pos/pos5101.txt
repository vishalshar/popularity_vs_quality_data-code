We just got these wall stickers for our son's room and were pleasantly surprised by the quality considering how much we paid for. Our son only wanted to use two dogs, which btw resemble alot like our two puppies and some butterflies so we decided to decorate our foyer with the rest of the stickers. The stickers feel a little thin comparing other wall stickers we bought but they peeled out so easily and got on the wall with no problem. I even repositioned a couple of times without any issue. I would recommend this to any dog lovers. I am even thinking about getting a second one for our other son's room.Also, the sellers delivered the product in less than a week's time, even with the 4th of July holiday. Great job.
