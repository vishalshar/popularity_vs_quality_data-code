This is a nice mat for a small child.  My average height 2 year old uses it for naptime at daycare and he really likes it.  The pattern is very colorful and vibrant.  Also there is a piece of paper that you can slide in a little compartment to put the child's name on it.  You need to remember to remove the paper prior to washing since it is only a piece of cardboard material but the compartment is handy in that you can make your own label as well and place it in the pouch.  I gave this mat four stars since it is very thin material and they use a mat underneath to have more cushion since the mat alone would be hard if placed right on floor.  Also the pillow is a little lumpy and you have to even it out after washing.  So far I have washed it a few times with no issues.  I have not had to put it in the dryer yet, only air-dried it in the laundry room.  This is an advantage of it being thinner since it does not take forever to dry.  Overall this is a good mat for the price you pay.  I did not want to pay double the price for other ones I saw and I am glad I made the choice to get this one.
