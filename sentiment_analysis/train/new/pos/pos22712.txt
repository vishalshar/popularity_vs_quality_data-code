I have a 3 month old who I have been exclusively pumping for since he was born. I didn't have the $ for a decent electric breast pump so I used the Medela manual pump. After just a couple of weeks of continuous use it lost its suction power, not to mention I always had to use two hands to use it and it always leaked my milk everywhere. I had a backup Evenflo that was torture using. A relative bought me a Playtex electric pump but I couldn't take how slow and loud it was and the fact that I couldn't move when I was using it. When you are exclusively pumping it is really important to be fast and mobile!! So I finally bought this pump and could not be happier. It is perfect - I use it every day, between four and six times a day, and so far no problems. It never leaks milk from the horn like other ones do, it takes only one hand to pump, and it has not come even close to losing suction. But even if that were to happen they give you an extra part! You will not regret buying this pump!
