My first son, now 3 yrs old, would not use any sippy cup we bought (we wasted a lot of money on a lot of cups!). We purchased one of these online and it was so simple, he drank from it right away, with still needed his bottle to go to bed to at night but that quickly changed after a week or two!. I recently ordered two as a first birthday gift for my best friends little boy because they were hard up on money and wasted a lot on other cups that he also would not use. He drinks from it! I plan to purchase a couple more because we now have twin boys (7 months old) so instead of wasting money on other sippys this is what we will use! One note i will make is my 3 yr old will only use this cup still, or the born free sippy cups sold at babiesrus/toysrus, but he dfrinks from big boys cups a lot now also.only Con i can think of about this cup is i'm pretty sure it said dish washer safe, but the more i used it in dish washer the plastic started getting little lines that looked like cracks in it but it wasn't cracked but i feared it would if i kept that up, but was no biggy because i now wash all his sippy's and all bottles by hand because i wasn't confident that they were getting cleaned in dish washer. Compared to the born free brand he uses, the plastic is a lot cheaper made on the thinkbaby cup but not a problem, it's been thrown, dropped, etc and still usable and it is over 2 years old now lol.
