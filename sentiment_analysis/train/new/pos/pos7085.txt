Great pads. I been using different ones for more than 2 years now , tried alot of brands and so far this is my favorite. Absorbed very well,  will hold trough the night and the day. Very comfy. It only has one line that stick,  but it will hold very well ( I was scepticall about it but surprised to see how well this will hold.)I love the size of the pack as well.each pad is individualy wrapped so it's great to take with you in your purse in case you need .also you will get 2 extra pads for night time that absorbed great as well. I really like these pads. And I think for the quality the price is great.  I would recommend this to all nursing moms out there .
