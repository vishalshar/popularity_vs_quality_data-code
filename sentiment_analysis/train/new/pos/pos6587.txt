My son is almost 6mos old but he still doesn't have good control of his Moro reflex. He is still tightly swaddled at night so he can get a good 9-10hrs of sleep but in the daytime I've been trying to transition him out of the swaddle for naps. He isn't able to go cold turkey without anything (I've tried & he's cried after 1 min). These keep him comfy without his arms flailing but he's still able to move his arms around a lot. He loves having something on his legs & seems to like that it hugs his hips. We live in Hawaii where it's always hot so I choose to get this one with the cool mesh cutout up top. The material is still thick so he does get hot with only a onesie on underneath, even with our AC on all day. Also it is a fight to get him into this & zip him up cause his arms are always going crazy trying to get out while I'm zipping it up. But once he's in it he settles down quickly & falls asleep on his own. I do wish this style had the arm buttons so you could start leaving one arm out. However so far it's working & hopefully we'll be out of this & the swaddle very soon.
