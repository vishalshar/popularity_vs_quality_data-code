I really like this booster seat. It has an awesome Paul Frank print and is a breeze to get in and out of the car. However, the little rubber-like padding it has on the arm rests was like a magnet for my son, who quickly tore it up by pulling it out of the recessed area on the top portion of the arm rest. The material used for the seat cover is soft, but gets dirty pretty quickly. The super easy removal and installation of this booster seat almost makes me forget the cheesy rubber bits still stuck in the glue on the arm rests and the now dingy blue color surrounding all the monkey faces...until I remember how much I paid for this seat!
