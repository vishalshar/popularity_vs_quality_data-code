Really love this! It was by far the cutest jungle animal mobile I found outside of spending over $100 on Etsy. Great thing #1: The faces of the animals are angles downwards so the baby can see them. Great thing #2: It's a windup, so no wasting $$ on batteries.  Great thing #3: Love the plush giraffe covering the long plastic arm. Many mobiles just have exposed plastic, which doesn't look very nice.Not so great thing #1: No volume control, and it's rather loud. I can see this as a distraction rom crying rather than a sleep-inducer. Not so great thing #2: The assembly instructions are a bit lacking. It's not difficult to put together at all, but it took me a while to figure out where the loop for the hook that holds the actual mobile part was supposed to come out of the giraffe (it's right under his chin).I thought the wind-up dial was broken at first, but I actually just had to spin it clockwise for a while until it caught. It's working perfectly now. Also, it appears to me that this would only work in a crib with slatted sides, not on a dresser, over a changing table, etc. because of the way the attachment mechanism is made. However, it suits our purposes perfectly!
