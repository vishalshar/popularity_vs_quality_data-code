I purchased this seat for use in my G35 which has a very tight backseat. It fits well with room to move the seat back without hitting the child seat. This seat seems to be as comfortable for my son as the larger Boulevard that we have in our other car. (However, my son is on the small side being eleven months old and weighing 17 lbs). I do believe that this seat would probably not be comfortable for a newborn without head control. The side support does not keep my son's head from leaning when he falls asleep and I cannot imagine that it would support a newborn. This is our third Britax seat and we have been very happy with all. They seem to be comfortable and well made as well as consistently rated among the best for safety. This seat does tend to be more expensive than most of the competition but is worth the extra money in my opinion to keep my child safe.
