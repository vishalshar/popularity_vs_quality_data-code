With a newborn and a 17 month old, we were in dire need of a spacious but portable/convenient diaper bag.  Our previous Diaper Dude bag had shredded along the edges of the zipper, and barely accomodated the gear for one.This diaper bag is amazing.  When it arrived, I was a bit disappointed, as it really doesn't look very big.  Boy, was I wrong.  I can easily fit 5+ diapers for each kid, spare outfits, nursing cover, toys, books, snacks, and winter hats/gloves.  And, with all the pockets, it stays relatively organized!I am surprised by how much I like the side wipe dispenser.  We removed the jeep plastic case, and replaced it with the store bought plastic wrapped wipes (works great), and don't have to refill - just swap out for a full container when needed.Also, the straps are comfortable, and fit myself and my hubby (6ft6in) well.The only non-shining star is the changing pad - which is fine, but relatively flimsy.  But, it works fine.... (and there is plenty of space in the bag if you wanted to swap it out).This bag is amazing.  You will not be disappointed.
