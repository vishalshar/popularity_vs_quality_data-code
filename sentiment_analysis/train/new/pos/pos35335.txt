This overal is a great monitor. I love the big screen and the option to sync more than just one camera. My only issue is i have bought this unit twice because the small prong in the charging slot keeps breaking off! Not sure if I just have the worst luck or if this is another defect of the unit but its extremely upsetting and I jabe uet to find a fix for it.
