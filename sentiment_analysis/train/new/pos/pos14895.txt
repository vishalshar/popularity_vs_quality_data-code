My daughter and I did extensive research  on what type bottle to use for her new baby - especially as she was nursing and needed to get baby on bottle (pumped breastmilk) before heading back to work.  These bottles have worked perfectly.  She tried the bottles and nipples that came with her Medela Breast Pump but they allowed baby to drink too fast and she had some choking issues.  We did more research and then decided to try the Dr. Brown's 4 oz. bottles first (as she was not eating too much at the time).  The nipples that came with that system were Level 1 and she also seemed to eat too fast, even though less choking.  We read a review here at Amazon.com mentioning the Preemie nipples, so we bought and began using those.  Worked perfectly.  Baby had to eat slower, more sucking needed, seemed more like breastfeeding.We have now upgraded to the 8 oz. bottles as "our" 4 monther + 15 pounder, is doing fantastic and needs more at her feedings than the 4 ounce bottles allow (don't have to refill during feeding).  BTW I babysit her every day while daughter at work so I have first hand experience with these bottles.We do burp her after 4 ounces and try to get a 10 minute break between the first and 2nd 4 ounces (total 8 ounce per feeding) and this works well - most of the time!  Have kept the preemie nipple as she still breastfeeds when mamma not at work.No gas, no colic, no choking.Hope this helps and they work out for your baby too.
