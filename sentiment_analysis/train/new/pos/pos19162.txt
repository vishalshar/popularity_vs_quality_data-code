We LOVE this. However, let me preface it by saying the monitor sucks. We could hear our children, but the receivers had a lot of static. I couldn't have the receivers on my desk or in the same room since you'd just hear buzzing. I called Fisher Price and they sent me a new receiver, but it had the same problem - lots of static. So I got an evenflo monitor and that solved that problem. So do not get this for the monitor.So why do I like it? The fish part (projection/music) is awesome. We got this when my daughter was 6 months old. We could adjust the volume and it would project swimming fish on the ceiling to either silence, ocean waves, or music. Or you could just turn on the sound and leave the projection off. Lots of options. The projection was nice and bright and the base could be tilted to get the projection right over where she was sleeping. And it was nice music, not annoying music. It would also go on if it detected noise (like my daughter crying). It stays on for 8 minutes (so wouldn't go on forever and ever). My daughter loved it. She is now 6 years old and still loves it. She can turn it on by herself and what can I say - we've had it for over 5 years, had to replace the light bulb twice (got the bulb at Target), and have had no problems. It helps her go to sleep and stay in her bed.My son (her little brother) loves it too and we have to share it between them at night since I cannot find another one. Someone please sell me another one!To me, I couldn't care less about the monitor part (it would have been nice, but no big deal), but the nice projection on the ceiling and the nice music or ocean that was invaluable to me. My only suggestion is to have an option to adjust the brightness. It is a little bright, at one point around 4 years old she used it to see and to play in her room when she was supposed to be sleeping. She outgrew that phase though.
