This night light is very cute and works well, but it's not ideal for a toddler.  My 3-year-old was very excited about it, as he loves Mickey.  Looking back, I'm not sure why we bothered even trying to use any sort of night light that's accessible to a toddler, in a toddler's room.  It lights up, is attractive, and is plugged into the wall; all things that will definitely tempt your toddler to play with this night light, and possibly cut himself or ingest glass, and/or electrocute himself.  Needless to say, after my toddler broke the night light, we went ahead and tossed it.
