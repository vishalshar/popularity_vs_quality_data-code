I do this like set. The only thing that bothers me is not knowing whether it is BPA free or not.  I liked that it came with the toothbrush, a tooth massager and a fingerbrush.There are a few other things that bother me though... The tooth massager is almost like a stick and putting that in my babies mouth freaks me out.  I'm sure it's definitely helping getting his teeth to come out of the gums but I'm afraid of him choking on it or hurting it in his mouth.  I of course hold it but babies love to grab.  I really think it's kind of dangerous.Also, I wish the finger brush didn't have bristles on it.  One side just has the regular bumps and the other has bristles.  Why do you need bristles on a finger brush?  The finger brushes is for cleaning gums and when they have teeth you go to the toothbrush.  The bristles get in the way when I use the non-bristle side.  It just seems this product was well intended but not fully thought out.
