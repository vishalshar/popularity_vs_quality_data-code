We live in Europe and like to go to a lot of markets where a stroller just isn't practical.  And my baby is not patient enough for my 3 hour shopping sprees at my favorite clothing store.  So we tried the Bjorn.  Its just the coolest baby product.  I can get my 13 lb two month old in and out of it all by myself and can wear him for hours and never get a hurt back.  The straps are nice and wide and perfectly padded.  My husband even likes wearing the Bjorn.  I've seen mothers with some of the other less expensive brands of "snuglis" on and the straps look so uncomfortable.  They look like they are digging canyons into their sides and backs.  Plus their babies hang so low and they don't even look comfortable themselves.  My baby boy is asleep within five minutes of being put in the Bjorn.  He wakes up now and then, takes a look up, sees Mommy or Daddy's face and happily goes right back to sleep.  The only drawback I've found it that in hot weather it is very warm for both Mom and Baby in the Bjorn.  I can imagine that happens with every carrier.  I got the City black one and it looks very stylish.  I don't feel like I'm wearing some God awful plaid/pastel/cartooney looking thing.  So this weekend we're off to Prague...and we'll strap on the baby in the Bjorn, sling on our diaper backpack and hit the town!  Highly recommended product.  Worth the money.  Durable and long lasting material and craftsmanship.
