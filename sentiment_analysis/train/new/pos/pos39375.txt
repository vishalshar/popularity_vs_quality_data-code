This blanket is very soft and the perfect addition to the Pocoyo bedding set.  It quite nicely adds an extra level of warmth.  The size of the blanket is great for a 2 1/2 year old to manage and carry around, as my grandson does.  Every little one should have the perfect cuddle blanket and this one is it for my grandson!
