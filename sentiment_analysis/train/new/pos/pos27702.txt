My son got this chair for his first birthday and loves it!  It is big enough that he has lots of room to grow into it.  It seems to be very well crafted and sturdy.  We scotch-guarded it, so it's protected against stains.  I love this print because it matches his nursery theme, but also because it isn't so "kiddy-themed" and won't look gaudy in our living room.  We would highly recommended this chair!!
