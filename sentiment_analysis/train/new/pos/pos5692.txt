I bought this baby car seat cover set through the amazon warehouse deals so I paid about $15 less than purchasing via the regular way brand new. As of this review, the price for the small brand new is $45. The small is for an infant car seat and comes with the plastic weather shield and mosquito net.I tested both the day I got it and have to say I am very pleased with both. I like that the plastic cover does not have a plastic smell AT ALL and is quite durable. It kept my baby warm when we were outdoors. I really like that this shield has an accessible area covered via a flap instead of a zipper. As soon as we're out of the elements, I just flip the flap open and back so that she has great ventilation, something that I preferred over ventilation holes in other brands of weather shield. Out doors, not flipping it is fine because it's open enough to let air in. I'll have to test the mosquito net when spring arrives and I'll update my review then.The item was described as "Open box - Like New", but to me it looked like it wasn't even used. It looked like someone ordered, opened it up, didn't like it, and then returned the item. As for packaging from amazon's warehouse deals, it was exactly as described: comes with original packaging, but packaging will be damaged. The only part of the packaging that was damaged was the shipping box. It had a few slices here and there, but otherwise still retained original shape. The packaging for the product itself was not damaged, but rather undone.All in all, I am very satisfied with this  purchase and product.
