I wanted a bedroom set for my baby that was neutral, as I didnt know the sex of the baby.  The nursery walls are green and I knew I wanted cream/brown to be the accent.  This looks just as it's pictured. The blanket is nice a think and will keep your child warm when old enough to use.  The bumpers are also very soft and adorable- and once my daughter started to roll over I felt comfortable using them.  She seems to enjoy laying against them sometimes and I really like how soft they are.  I got the matching sheet which has held up through many washes. My daughter is now 9 months old and everything still looks brand new.  We will be using this bedding for our next baby and are thrilled we went with a neutral color.  Overall I think it's a great purchase!
