After having the single and doing a lot of hands-on research we decided to stick with B.O.B. brand and get the double. I went running with a lot of moms with other strollers, tested some out in stores, and asked questions everywhere I went in stores. It seemed too bulky at first, but overall isn't any bigger than the others. Our single we have had over two years- it has gone on 31 flights (on/off lower storage on planes), been in three color-runs, 3 off trail breast cancer runs, hiking Yosemite/Tahoe, and endless trips around towns. We had one flat tire after a 5k run off road. i was never dissatisfied with the single and the double is proving the same. You MUST measure your vehicle though. I have seen low reviews on it not fitting, but that could be prevented by taking 5 minutes to measure your vehicle. If you must the wheels are very simple to pop off and on. There is nothing on the market like B.O.B brand strollers for the cost. R.E.I. will service/repair B.O.Bs in their bike department if needed, and sell all the attachments if you want to make sure they fit.. and I have always had great customer service regardless of not buying them there.
