I received this feeder as a gift, and just recently started using it. My 6-months old baby loves it! I read through the reviews and decided to offer these in perspective1. Many reviewers complained that it can be easily opened and are dangerous for babies in that regard. I found this to be true ONLY when you overstuffed the feeder. When moderately filled, it as tight as it could be and will need some kind of force to pull open.2. Some also complained about the small amount that this feeder can hold. In my opinion, this is a perfect size for my baby's mouth, and not too heavy for my baby to hold it by himself. But if you're purchasing this item thinking that it will be handy to feed a hungry baby, then yes, the small size might be an issue. I used this only to provide snacks for my baby in between his meals (plus slowly introducing fruits into his diet). If he's hungry, I'll spoon him all the food he needs via the traditional way, not by using this feeder.Other pros - easy to clean, and holds great on baby's hand, fun colors too. I love it so much that I ordered a second one.Good luck in deciding if this is something that suits your baby's needs.
