After the birth of my second child within a two year period, I knew I needed a kick-ass diaper bag to schlep around two sets of diapers, wipes, beverages, snacks, toys and clothes. Knowing that you get what you pay for when it comes to diaper bags, I knew I was wanted something versatile and quality made, that could be used for a long time. Because I have a son and a daughter, and I have modern tastes, I wanted something gender neutral that didn't look too whimsical or babyish. I finally found the Ju-Ju Be earth leather bags and fell in love because they look more adult, they are highly functional, in addition to being washable and high quality.I purchased and returned many bags before I finally settled on the Be Fabulous, including the larger Be-Prepared. I found the Prepared bag to be a little too large for my tastes. I think the Be-Prepared is perfect for day trips and carries all the supplies I need for two young children. The many, many pockets make it easy to give everything its own place, and provide ease when retrieving those items. The key holder and mommy pocket are invaluable. The pockets keep bottles and drinks cool. The straps are comfy even when the bag is full, and are long and strong enough to hang over my Bob stroller handles when I am out.I have owned this bag for a little over a year now and I still totally love it. It still looks great and has no signs of wear.A recommendation I have is to purchase the Ju-Ju-Be Be Quick wristlet (or maybe 5 of them) to use as a purse or quick diaper change bag. I use mine as a purse that drops into my diaper bag. That way if I just need my wallet and cell, I can just grab that small bag and take care of business. The wristlets are cute and also look good as a simple clutch!!Ju Ju Be all the way!
