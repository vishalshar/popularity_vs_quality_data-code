OK, new parents, here's the deal: Some kids are good sleepers, and some are not. Read all the books you want, listen to all the advice you can stomach, but just know that all the soothers, sleep sheep, "magic" turtles, projected stars, rocking chairs, and bouncy seats in the world are not going to turn your little night owlet into a Baby Rip Van Winkle. Only time and trial & error can do that.Howeverâ€¦ there are some items that can make your life a little bit easier and help your baby learn to put herSELF to sleep. This is one of them. It is not the silver bullet (only mommy's breasts have that magical power, but that's another can of worms); but it has been an essential, indispensable weapon in our arsenal to help our kid learn rational sleeping patterns. Here's what you need to know:1) You must also have a white noise machine that does not have a timer, so you can turn it on and off at will. We use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homedics-SS-5010-Soundspa-Premier-Clock/dp/B002JZ0T78/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1388627305&sr=8-13&keywords=clock+radio+white+noise">Homedics Soundspa Premier</a>. The soother is not the same thing as a white noise machine. You need both if you want to have white noise. This one turns off after 18 minutes (at most), and if your baby is like ours, she'll be up like a jack-in-the-box the minute the thing stops making noise.2) As has been mentioned numerous times, the light is too dang bright. It doesn't matter. It still helps her sleep.3) There are several combinations of settings you can use. If you turn on all the bells and whistles at once, you get a shorter "on" time and a shorter battery life. We use the lights/no motion/rainforest sounds/lullabies setting and I replace the batteries about every three months.We moved from family bed to crib at around 14 months, and our daughter didn't sleep through the night until about 16 months (and still has occasional night-waking), but even then nap and bedtime was always a battle royale. At about 18 months I finally broke down and bought this soother thing because I saw another toddler using it to put himself to sleep at nap time. It took our kid a couple weeks to really get into it, but once she figured out how she could push the button herself, she stopped needing mommy & daddy to come in and soothe her back to sleep. It has been a lifesaver for us. We even got another one (second-hand) to use at the grandparents' house because we just cannot bear the thought of bedtime without it. Sometimes, late at night, we will hear her stirring or fussing a little bit; and then we hear the soothing sounds of Brahms' Lullaby on a pan flute and we know all is well.
