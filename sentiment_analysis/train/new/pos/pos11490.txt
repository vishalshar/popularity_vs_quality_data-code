I bought these for a dual purpose... To freeze home made baby food, and also ice cubes for chickens. The containers have an attached lid that snaps closed. All of them but one popped open after freezing even though I only filled to the max line. Next time I'll put less. These cubes hold maybe half the amount as baby's first store bought baby food containers. The one thing I didn't really like was the tray, they just sit on it and slide easily. They should have a way of locking in place for easier storage, but they still get the job done.
