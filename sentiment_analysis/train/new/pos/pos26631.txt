I found the Baby Bjorn carrier to be very useful, especially when I needed to walk the dog with the baby along.  Also, my son seems to get the most fussy around dinner time, and placing him the carrier allowed me to eat dinner with my family, even if it meant standing up rather than sitting down (it is difficult to sit with the carrier on as the child's legs are then forced to bend backwards).I also had some concerns about the plastic disc closures at the base of the carrier.  When my son was in the carrier for an extended period of time, he would have impressions in the clothing around his diaper area as though these closures were pressing into him.  It might be better if the carrier were designed with these covered with padding of some sort.
