I purchased this crib bedding after originally looking at the Cocalo Jacana baby bedding sold by Target (also on Amazon)..this is so much similar to the Cocalo Jacana, but quite a bit cheaper! It is everything I expected it to be, I did a lot of browsing when I was looking for crib bedding and this was by far the best bargain I came across. I did purchase the Cocalo Jacana wall appliques and plush monkey which really compliment the crib bedding and complete my little girls nursery, it is all very girly and cute. I also ordered the geenny mobile that goes with this crib set, beautiful!!! Would definitely recommend both the crib bedding and mobile!
