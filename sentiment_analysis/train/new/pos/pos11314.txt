MUCH MUCH larger than I anticipated…even noting the other reviews and the product dimensions.  This case is MASSIVE!  Easily holds our 4 passports (which are all in protected covers – color coded for ease of distribution), boarding passes, credit and/or loyalty cards, and associated travel documents… GREATLY simplified my life…Our overseas travel was a breeze!4 Stars (true assessment 4.5) only because I would have appreciated at least the option for a zip around closure…  But the elastic made me slow down to make sure that my documents were properly stowed.  Overall, an EXCELLENT case, GREAT for families, and money WELL spent!
