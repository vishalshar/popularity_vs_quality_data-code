I purchased this set because I needed more bottles, nipples & a sterilizer to add to my Avent collection.  I am quite pleased with the overall quality of the Avent products, and this set does not disappoint.  My husband and I love the wide bottles because they are easier to clean and you can use them to store & heat other things in (such as baby food).  I have not used the included sippy cup as my daughter is not old enough yet, but I like that the Avent bottles convert that way.  I have also used the Avent converters for my breast pump so I am able to pump directly into my baby's bottles if needed.  The included sterilizer is awesome for sterilizing bottles, pump parts, pacifiers, etc. in just 2 minutes!  This would make a great gift for a new mom if she is choosing to use the Avent line.  The only downfall is that sometimes the wider 9oz bottles don't fit in a regular bottle warmer.  We just use a mini crock pot filled with distilled water to warm them.
