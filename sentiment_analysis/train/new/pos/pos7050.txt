My 9 month old refuses to let me spoon feed him.  He keeps his mouth clothes, grabs the spoon and plays with it. He prefers to self-feed.  This spoon is pricey but worth it. My son will grab the spoon and chew on the ends.  It is his new favorite toy.  Perfect if the ends are filled with food.  At least with this spoon he will eat a few bites purees and mush now (hard to take it out of his hands to refill... but I'm going to get a couple more so I can swap them out).  With other spoons, he usually will get the un-loaded end into his mouth.  With this spoon, either end will work.  Also with the deep spoon, more gets delivered to the mouth instead of falling out as he maneuvers it to his mouth.  Yes, mealtimes are messy... but it's easy enough to clean up with the phil-and-ted clamp on seat and the summer infant place-mats.  Everything just gets dumped into the sink.
