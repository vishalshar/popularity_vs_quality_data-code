We received one of these for my grandson as a present. At around 4 months he fell in love with it. At 5 months Christmas was coming and his love for it was growing, I thought, what happens if we/he looses it? So I bought him another because he loves it. I did get him a set of 'simple' non-nubby keys for Christmas, and he loves those equally. He'll have keys in one hand, lion in other hand and rotates which goes in his mouth. I guess it's kind of nice when you find 'THE' present for a person, even if he's only 6 months.Oh, and yes it squeaks, but he can't squeak it, which has it's good points because the constant squeaking might get really annoying, but even while he's chewing lion's head, it doesn't squeak. We squeak it for him and he starts laughing!
