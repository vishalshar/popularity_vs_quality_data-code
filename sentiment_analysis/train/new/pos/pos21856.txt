I bought this blanket for my daughter in December of 2010 and it is still like new! I have not had any issues with piling. In fact, it is just as soft as the day I bought it. I used it during the cooler months as a blanket to cover her car seat, during nap time, and also to just cuddle with. It was so nice and soft I bought one as a gift and it was well received.I was folding it today and came back here to see how long I have had it and can't believe how well it has held up. I wash in cold water with dye free detergent and fabric softener. I then use fragrance free dryer sheets on a low setting. It keeps it like new!
