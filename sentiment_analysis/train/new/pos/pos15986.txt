I did not know these had bumps around the base so now my son LOVES this since he is teething. These are his favorite paci's. We got them because they display my husband's fave team and now we love them because our son quiets once he puts it in his mouth. When one of these in front of him and another brand he quickly reaches for the SF paci. Can not love them more. Just wish the paint wouldn't come off. They don't say 49er's anymore :( But we'll be buying more and we'll save one to put away in a picture frame one day.
