These fit my 20 month old daughters well. One of my daughters is 20 lbs (5th %) and the other is 24 lbs (50th %). Both are fairly tall (34 inches - 90%). On the smallest snap these work well. They are a little bulky in the butt. They are very absorbent (even without an insert) to the point that maybe they don't work that great for potty training, my daughter didn't seem to care or realize she was wet. They pull on and off fairly easily and the snaps are good for BMs. Overall I think this is a good product. Her pants did not get wet while wearing these.
