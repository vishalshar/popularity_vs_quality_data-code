I really like this ball/rattle.  It makes a soft jingly noise that my LO one loves.  The ribbon tags are very satiny and the colored lines of the ball are a soft felt-like material.  The black/white lines are a different kind of fabric that is screen printed.  They feel a little sticky to me and that is the only thing I don't love about it.  This ball is about the size of large grapefruit so it's not a tiny, but it is lightweight and very easy for little hands to grasp.
