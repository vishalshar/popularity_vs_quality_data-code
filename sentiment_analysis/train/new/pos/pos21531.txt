Only the best pacifier clip ever invented! I recommend this to every new mom I know! I'd recommend this to every mom, but all of the experienced moms I know already have this brand. ;)The clip is super easy and quick to attach, and it is gentle on clothing. I have a delicate dress my baby wore. I was nervous about attaching a pacifier clip to it, but this clip didn't leave any indication that it was there, very nice! It is also small compared to most clips, which makes it easy to attach to any type of clothing in a non awkward way.
