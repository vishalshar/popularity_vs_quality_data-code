These have been on my wishlist for some time now so when they came back in stock I ordered them immediately.  While establishing milk production in the first few weeks of nursing a newborn, it can be difficult and at times very sore.  These soothing therapy pillows are great and really easy to use.  I'm not a fan of using these for a cooling effect, but that's simply because I don't like cold things touching me.  I did try it, however, and it stays cool for a bit while in place.  So if you're looking for cooling relief, these definitely do the job.I prefer to use them for a warming relief and to get my milk flowing.  I put them in the microwave for about 2 minutes so they'd get nice and warm, and I have to say, it felt great when I put them in place.  On one occasion I had just finished pumping and then used these for about 5-7 minutes.  I went back to pumping right after and actually expressed an additional half an ounce.  If you're a nursing mother, you know how valuable even an extra half an ounce can be.  I was super excited about this.  The warming effect must have opened up some clogged milk ducts or simply helped to get the milk flowing.The pillows are very large, a lot larger than I expected, but it's a good thing because they are kind of like one size fits all.  I'm always around a C/D cup and the pillows do a nice job of completely covering everything, ensuring all or most milk ducts are affected.  Since these can't be washed, to prevent leaking on the pillows I used the Bamboobies nursing pads that came with them, in between the pillow and my breast and didn't have a problem.  When I'm not using the pillows I keep them stored in the plastic bag they were packaged in.  I would hate for them to get dirty since they can't be washed.Overall, I would highly recommend these soothing therapy pillows.  They've definitely helped me.
