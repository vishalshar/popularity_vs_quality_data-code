This dresser is exactly what one would get if not wanting to spend a lot of money. It's extremely affordable, easy to put together, nice finish, and does the job. It's not top of the line where you would spend $500. plus. You get what you pay for. I am exteremly pleased with this product. It matches the other pieces in the room very will. Shipping was very fast and when it arrived packaging was great. I constructed it in less than an hour. There are no "tools" that come with this dresser. It is called "hardware" I put it together with one screwdriver. Everyone who gave this dresser one star is an idiot! They seem to want five star product at a one star price. Complaining on how to put it together, what its's made of and so on, Blah, Blah, Blah. This is not rocket science people. Stop bitching about crap and get a clue! You want top quality? spend top money! As for me, I would buy this again and yes it's worth what I paid for it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.
