This blanket really is SO soft!! Unfortunately, when I washed it for the very first time the day I received it the satin edging pulled away from where it was attached to the blanket. The hole was about 5 inches long. So I don't think the quality is all that good. not a huge deal because amazon customer service made it right. All that being said, it seriously is so soft and I would recommend based on that alone as well as the really cool paint pony pattern. Oh and, I know the description says "fleece" but I wouldn't describe the texture as fleece at all. This is nothing like a fleece blanket. The texture is more like a nicely done faux fur on the patterned side and minky in the reverse side.
