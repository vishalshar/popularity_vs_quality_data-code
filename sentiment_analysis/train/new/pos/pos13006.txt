My reason for purchasing a booster chair is because it is a space saver in my small kitchen (as compared to my 16 month old daughter's high chair).  I have only used this one for 1.5 weeks so far, but I find it to be quite efficient.  It's very basic, but serves its purpose.  My daughter seems to be comfortable with in it.  I either use the tray or push her up to the dinner table next to me.  I have not used it on the go yet so I can't speak on that aspect of it.  However, I think it's pretty much worth its price.
