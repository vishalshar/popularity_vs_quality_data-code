These are wonderful gifts for showers and/or hospital visits.  The new parents always love them and the unexpected presentation is great.  The clothes are soft and nice.  I agree with the one reviewer that the plastic was a little scratched on the packaging, but it had it in a day and the inside was beautiful.  I have bought several and would def buy again.
