Amazing purchase! My 2 1/2 yr old daughter started becoming scared of the dark, this night light is perfect for her, the blue light gives off alot of light to illuminate the room so shes not scared to fall asleep, it also has a green and red light that are darker.  It has settings to have the colors change, a 30 minute timer, or keep the light on all night.  The rechargeable battery is great! Light doesn't get hot so she sleeps with it and can carry it around.  Another plus, my daughter loves it!! Would absolutely recommend this for any child who needs a night light
