I bought this for my daughters 1st birthday. She has a bird and nature theme room and party. This bead maze is aesthetically pleasing to even just have out as display in her room. She loves playing with it, only entertains her for a little while because it's not like one of those big ones you see in waiting rooms. Ours has NOT chipped any paint, the paint is perfect.
