This is adorable and so comfy and cushy and my grandson loves riding in it! BUT Omgosh was it a pain to get installed into my 2002 Toyota Celica!  The seat belts can't be twisted, which happens in older cars, and you have to fasten the lap belt across the bottom rear facing path while keeping ALL the slack out on the shoulder belt, which, since the car is older, kept locking on me before it was all out.  I finally got all the slack of the shoulder belt slowly fed out without it locking too soon and it fit perfectly across the rear facing path on the back of the seat.  Once I did that, I had to stand in the back of my 2 door Celica..haha..not easy for this grandma, and shimmy the seat with my body while using both hands to make sure that shoulder belt and lap belt were locked and tight.  Once in though, it is perfectly horizontal (no pool noodle required) and it fits beautifully down into the cushion of the faux bucket seat in the back. It's tight and secure!  It was worth the trouble!!  I won't be taking it out anytime soon, though lol  What saved me was the YouTube video by the car seat lady called "Combi Coccoro Installation Rear Facing with the Vehicle's Shoulder/Lap Belt"!  God bless her!!!  If you are having trouble, watch it.  I got the Key Lime color..love it :) http://youtu.be/BW62wTqx5Z4
