This mat is bright and colorful and matches my son's dinosaur nursery. As others have mentioned, the exact number of colored tiles does not match the picture here. We received four blue tiles, four orange tiles, two green, two blue, two brown. I was prepared for this thanks to the previous reviews and I was able to find a color combination that looked good! (The key was making an X out of the four blue and four orange tiles, then filling in the gaps with alternating sets of two). Overall I really like this mat, and it is certainly great for the price! It's fun that you can mix and match the similar dinosaur shapes and take them out to play with them. It is also a pretty good looking mat. We also have already gotten compliments on it from friends at play dates.
