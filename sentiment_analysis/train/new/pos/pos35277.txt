Most of my friends had kids by the time I got pregnant.  One of their kids had problems eating and her doctor told my friend to get Dr. Brown's bottles.  So when it came time for me to register for my baby shower, I figured Dr. Brown's bottles were the way to go.  I love them.  I have had several people say that my son spits up much less than most babies.  However, there are a couple extra parts with these bottles that need to be cleaned with a small brush (included).  If you're a new mom and you don't know any different, get these bottles and use the best right from the start.  But if you've used bottles that only have 3 parts (the bottle itself, the nipple and nipple ring), you're probably not going to like having 2 extra pieces to clean after every feeding.  It will take some getting used to, but I think they're worth it.  As I said, I think these bottles are the greatest.  I wouldn't have done it any differently.
