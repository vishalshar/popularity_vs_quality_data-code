I purchased 2 of these before my son was born to go along with his whale theme. They are so cute! I only wish I would have measured out the dimensions, because they were bigger than I expected. I was hoping they could be his special snuggle animals, (hence why I ordered 2, I wouldn't want to lose one and then be without it!) but they are too big for him to get his arms around right now (at 4 months old). It is perfect for taking his monthly pictures with, to show his growth! Hopefully he will love them and be able to snuggle them when he's older.
