I absolutely LOVE our Skip Hop Activity Mat and so does our 8 week old son.  When shopping for baby playmats, I narrowed it down between the Boppy Entertain Me Play Gym and the Skip Hop and I am glad I chose this.  What I love most about this product is it's beautiful, modern and simple design, compared to the overly busy playmats available on the market.  Even the animals have a distinct, modern look that both grown-up and children alike can enjoy.  This playmat looks great in our modern home and modern nursery.Our 8 week old son first looked at the pig and cooed, then took a liking to the cow that has a mirror on it and he just stared and cooed with more delight.  All the hanging animals have a fun developmental and interactive feature.  The sheep plays a musical song when pressed, the cow has a mirror, the rabbit is attached to a rattle and the pig has a whimsical chime.  Even the mat itself has developmental play pieces for baby to discover - the cow squeaks, the duck has a crinkly wing and the rabbit has a velcro carrot that rattles.  It also comes with a mini pillow for tummy time which we have used, but it is pretty small and looks like it will get outgrown quickly.  It's perfect for now though. The mat is a nice sized square and feels like a well-made quilt.It is a stylish playmat for design-conscious parents and a functional/interactive developmental toy for babies.
