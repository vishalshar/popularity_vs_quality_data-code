This is the perfect insert for out Bloom Loft Chair (see my review).  The materials are sturdy and well crafted.  I love the fact that it comes with the two differently sized inserts; this allows your child to grow into the chair, not out of it.  And the style; WOW, the gold looks so cool with the super-shiny black chair; there's absolutely NOTHING else like it!
