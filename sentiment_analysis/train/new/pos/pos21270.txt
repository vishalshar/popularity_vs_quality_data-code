I purchased the green bassinet, understanding that other reviewers had been displeased with the product based on them not receiving the pictured color they chose. I wasn't crazy about the green one pictured, but I figured I would get something different, and the price was right.Well I was right, I didn't get the pictured green bassinet, and I actually like the "surprise" color better! It's mostly a neutral beige, with accents of green grid on beige. It's really very cute.The bassinet itself is very classic in build, and seems sturdy enough. The pad is also thicker and softer than others I have used.Other reviews complained about a smell, I noticed a slight smell, but it didn't smell chemical or overpowering at all. Washing and airing-out should get rid of any smell.I think in order for this product to get better reviews, the seller should make sure to put accurate pictures of the product colors, or at least to inform buyers that colors may vary. I recommend this product, but not if you are dead set on which color you do or do not want, prepare for a little leeway in the color when you receive the product.
