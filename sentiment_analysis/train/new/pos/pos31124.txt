This swing has been a LIFESAVER with my newborn son!  He has acid reflux and spends a LOT of time in his swing.  It was really easy and fast to put together.  The swing has a lot of really convenient features such as the one handed reclining feature, the buttons that fold the swing in so it is easily moved, the extra large and comfy seat (will get longer use) and the wide array of music and nature sounds.  We have gotten really good battery milage out of this as well!  Our son was in the swing for probably 28 hours over the last two weeks, and we have not had to change the batteries yet!  Highly recomended!
