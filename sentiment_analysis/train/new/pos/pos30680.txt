there is a little strap that is kind of a pain for strapping the car seat into the stroller.  other than that i love it.it rides well and works good for a 6 foot person.  We took it to Australia with us and it seemed to survive the 8 different plane rides it went on with not trouble.  After about 2.5 months it is still in good working order.  The basket on the bottom is great and the cupholders and tray keep everything i need.2 things i would improve are the strap (they may use a strap because it fits lots of different seats) and i would put a cover on the tray between the cup holders.
