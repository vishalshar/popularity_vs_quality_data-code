This sweet doll was my great niece's first birthday gift.  As soon as she pulled it out of the gift sack, she gave it a big hug with a big smile on her face.  She loved  her immediately.  It was difficult to get the music to play and the checks to light up even for Elena's daddy.  But it didn't seem to matter to Elena.
