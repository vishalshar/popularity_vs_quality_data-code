I love this product!  I was so happy to find a nice bra to use as nursing and pumping.  Not only was I able to pump hands-free at work, but I could also pump one side and feed from the other without trying to juggle the breast shield and the baby at the same time.  I highly recommend for functionality.The reason for only four stars is that the sizing leaves much to be desired.  I was a DD, and I only purchased a D.  I was trying to follow the advice of the other reviewers.  The D was way too big for me too.  In other nursing bras, I wore a DD, but this one in a D was ginormous!  I think that it is so much bigger because of the extra material that is in the bra, they really should resize these bras so that we can purchase one that fits.
