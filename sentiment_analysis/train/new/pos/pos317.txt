We received the blue, green & orange one pictured for our son though I did hesitate since someone said they weren't able to specify color preference and received a pink one. Our baby loves it, loves to chew on the rubbery corners and scrunch it up to make it crinkle. Washing instructions on the package say to spot clean only, but this has been machine washed several times and hung to dry with no issues so far, and the squeaker still works just fine.
