I got this for my baby before he was even born. I am very pleased with the safe design and size for my little guy. He holds his hat and seems to really be comforted it by it in his car seat.I also recommend keeping it tucked in your shirt for a little bit when the baby doesn't have it to transfer your scent to it. It will also help your child feel more secure with it having your sent on it! Just a tip I discovered and seems to work!
