I purchased this Moses Basket on a bit of an impulse the first day I spent alone with my newborn, realizing quickly that I needed a safe place to put the baby down when I needed to make lunch or get water or go to the bathroom, and this has been exactly that.For the price, this basket is a great piece of baby gear. I wasn't expecting a super high quality piece (and it isn't, but I've had no fabric tears or loose ribbons yet), but have been very pleased with it, and especially knowing that it can only be used for a few months, I would recommend this lower cost basket to anyone considering a Moses basket purchase.  Also, the sheet included serves the purpose, but I found a receiving blanket wrapped snug around the mattress fit beautifully and is much cozier.**Update: Five months of daily usage and this basket is showing lots of wear - the raffia (or whatever the material is that is wrapped around the rows) is unravelling, breaking off, and loose in several spots, the basket itself split on the upper two rows at the foot, and the sides are sagging. Despite this wear, we still say this was the best baby item we've purchased (for the price + usage) and I'd still recommend it!
