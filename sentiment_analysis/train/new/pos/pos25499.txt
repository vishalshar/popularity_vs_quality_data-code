I love this product. It is very easy to use, and quite durable. It folds really flat and doesn't take that much room up in your freezer. Products stored in the cooler definitely stay cold for at least 8 hours. The outside fabric (a black microfiber type cloth) is easily cleaned, and the detachable strap allows you to hook the cooler on diaper bags, strollers, etc.The only thing is that I wish it was bigger. The measurements are listed in the product description, so I find no fault with Playtex and Amazon...but fitting in 2 bottles is a bit of a stretch and there is definitely no room for anything else...and although I don't use AVENT or Brown's wide neck bottles, I have some doubts about them fitting at all, as this cooler is kind of narrow in depth. I have tried to use the cooler (and it is indeed a double) for my toddler's sippy cup and infant's bottle and it was a no-go in the fridge-to-go.Otherwise, this was a great purchase.
