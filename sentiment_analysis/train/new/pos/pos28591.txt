Our daughter's room is about 65' from the master bedroom but there are probably 6-8 walls in between the two, including closets, hallways, and the bedrooms themselves.  After trying several monitors with 750-800 feet unobstructed ranges that would constantly cut in and out at night while we were sleeping and even had a bit of static while connected, we got this one and it handles the obstructed range without any problems.  New model (3038) no longer has chime at start-up and includes one-touch zoom and camera scrolling if you've got more than one camera hooked up to the monitor.
