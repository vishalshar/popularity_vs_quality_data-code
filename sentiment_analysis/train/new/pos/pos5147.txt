I looked at a few Baby Doll Car Seats before finally deciding on this item.  I'm very glad I went for this one.  The size is perfect for my above average height 2 year old.  It is also very light so no issues with a child injuring themselves lugging precious dolly around in it all day.  The colorway is also quite attractive.  It is isn't a subtle pink but being that bit darker it will hide a little grubbiness.  Having said that the cover looks really easy to whip off and pop in the washer.  This is an essential in my book for children's toys.  We have lots of play dates in our home and I like to wash all the soft stuff regularly. I also liked that the strapping has a proper clip rather than velcro.  I know my daughter will spend ages happily strapping baby in and then taking her out again. The quality looks excellent for the money I paid and I'm confident it will stand up to many many hours of delightful play.
