We purchased one of these for our daughter over a year ago and now our boy needed a car seat too so we went with the same type as they worked so well.  We took it out the box and put it in the living room and our little boy jumped in it straight away and within 20 mins was passed out and fast asleep.  He loves it, everytime we go out in the car he just settles down and relaxes.  He has plenty of room, can see out the windows and see everything that is going on and when he falls asleep, which he has done everytime so far, we can tip him back so he is more comfortable (although he is obviously more then happy even in the upright position).We have quite a small car, a Ford Focus Wagon, and now ahve one of thes on each side.  There is enough room in the middle for a small child or bags etc but not enough for a 3rd child seat but we don't need one yet.  I read some coments about certain parts not being very well made and I have to disagree, our daughters will be 2 years old this summer and has been put in and out of the car hundreds of times, it has been jumped on, bounced on, used a play toy in the house, dragged around the house, washed and everything and is still in perfect condition.  They are large but they are car seats, in our car there is not much leg room for anybody in the back so I expected that the kids would be able to reach the back of the seats and they do, I reconmend these to anyone who wants to have their children safe, secure and comfy and especially the ease for taking them in and out with the strap release is just another great feature, you can take the kids out after they have fallen asleep and just loosen the straps to get them out.  Plus the price is great for all the added function and features.If I ever need 3 car seats I will guarantee the 3rd one will be another one of these just in a different pattern again!!
