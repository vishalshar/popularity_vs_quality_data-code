Each month has a place for you to fill out baby's sleeping patterns, feeding schedule, some sounds and motions they're making, what they like and dislike, favorite toys and games, and what they're learning by the end of the month. The pages and stickers are super duper cute while still being gender neutral. Nothing is plain, it all has some sort of colored pattern background and there are plenty of frogs, ducks, bugs, monkeys, turtles, and snails. The stickers are cute, though I wish there were even more of them, but that's ok.Inside:All About Mommy & DaddyAll About YouFamily TreeEmpty months that you fill in, and one page of stickersLetters from Mommy & DaddyThe only negative: (and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5)Each month there's a box that says "(month)", which is where you put that month's sticker (like "January"). Well, on the thirteenth month, the one that will be your child's first birthday, they still wrote "month" in the box... the problem being that they only gave you ONE sticker for each month... so you don't have a sticker for the 13th month, but you can't just write it in by hand either. You'll have to type it out on the computer and make your own sticker label for that month. I mean, that is totally doable; I just find it to be a lack of foresight on their part. If they would have just not written "(month)" in the box, then you could hand-write that month in yourself. But since they did write "(month)" you have to cover it up even though they didn't provide the sticker to do so.
