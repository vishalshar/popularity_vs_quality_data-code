This fits a BOB! I have a BOB Revolution and was having a hard time justifying spending $60 on a rain cover.  I took a chance and ordered this cover based on the other reviews and the specs.  It fits perfectly!  I will update as we work our way through a Chicago winter... But for now color me happy!
