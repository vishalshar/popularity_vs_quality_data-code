I read numerous reviews on the various camera cases that I was considering for my Nikon CoolPix S9300.  This case had some reviews that said it did not fit and others that said it fit but was snug.  It does fit the camera and is great protection for it.  I have another roocase for one of my other cameras and it has been carried all over the world safely in the case so this was my first choice.  So glad that I did order it and while it is snug it fits fine.  There is a small mess interior pocket but I don't use it and carry the charging cable separately.  The carabiner clip on this case is not as heavy duty as the one on my older roocase but still provides an easy way to carry the camera attached to a belt loop or d ring on a bag.
