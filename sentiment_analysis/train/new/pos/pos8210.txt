For many years the hype in Hollywood has been the strange looking Bugaboo strollers. So for the features we bought one..The Good: As a  petite woman I especially appreciate the inclusion of short handles on a stroller. The Bugaboo Frog does have perfectly placed handles where height is concerned. I have no problem reaching the handles and pushing my child around. I also get a thrill out of the "one hand turn" that the Frog allows you to accomplish. I find that my son seems comfortable in the Frog longer than his other strollers. I have a Fisher Price knock-off that he can easily get his way out of. He does tend to hate strollers, though. The navy blue color is especially aesthetically pleasing, as is the off white quilted-like design of the hood's interior. I have no experience with any shock to the stroller, but from what I have been told Bugaboo's can take a real beating. The stroller also drives extra smooth.The Bad: I cringe each time that I have to fold the Frog up and place it into the car. The tutorial video at Bugaboo's website shows the model taking it apart completely, piece by piece. I have no time for that. Taking the seat portion off requires two people, usually. I have bad joints and squeezing the white buttons on the side will not work for me. Unfolding the frame is even more hard. The frame has the tendency to make itself turn backwards. It also locks up and creates a major pain for those trying to fold it. Bugaboo really should fix this design flaw.
