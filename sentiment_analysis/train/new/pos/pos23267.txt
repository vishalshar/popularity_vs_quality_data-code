My three year old son was thrilled to receive this bed set. It fits his toddler bed perfectly and is easy enough to maneuver that he can make the bed himself. The set appears to be well made and is exactly as described. The colors of the set are as vibrant as advertised and have not faded during washes. The comforter is incredibly soft, yet warm, allowing for an enjoyable experience for my little guy. I was very impressed with this set, and I'm likely to purchase from this product line again.
