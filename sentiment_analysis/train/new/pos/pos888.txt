So I got this for my baby as a first christmas gift when he was 5 months old.  I didn't use it for about a month because he was my little angel who slept great.  Fast forward to 6 months and suddenly he was waking ever 2 hours and I was going nuts.  I got this out and hooked it up.  I don't know if it was a coincidence but like magic he went to sleep and stayed asleep for the rest of the night.  The volume goes from whisper quiet to holy s*** what is that noise.  Also has port to hook up an MP3 player if you don't like what it comes with.  The night light feature gives off just enough light so you don't fall on your face in the dark at night.
