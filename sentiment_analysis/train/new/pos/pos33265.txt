We needed a sturdy gate at the top of our stairs that was pressure mounted because we had to mount it on both sides to our wood balusters.  We did tons of research and finally settled on this one.  We couldn't be happier with our pick!  It is extremely sturdy, doesn't move in the slightest (and we use it ALL day long), and is well built.  The hands-free option is an absolute must if you're getting this because you have small children.  I can step on the release and nudge the gate open with my knee, so my hands are still securely on my child in my arms.  I cannot imagine a child being able to open it because it does take quite a bit of pressure, in fact, our two year tries to step on it and can't budge it.  The gate swings nicely in both directions and easily latches back in place.  I don't especially like that the bar is underneath, but I also understand that there's no way around it.  I will say that at least the designers tried to alleviate the annoyance of the bar by adding in slopping plastic mounds around the bar.  They're not great but definitely better than just the bar.  We also had to get the extension and it works great.  Like other reviewers, I should mention that when you order the extension it's only ONE extension (I think about 5 inches or so), not two separate extensions, which is a little misleading in the description.  We were right on the edge of needing another extension but it actually works great with just the one.  Also, when you pull it out of the box it appears be bent, but it's made that way and it works once it's in.  It's also easy to assemble and install.  I highly recommend this gate!  We might even get another one for the bottom of the stairs because it works so well.
