I bought this changing pad cover and love it so much that I ended up buying the crib cover as well. The material is so soft and it breathes easy. It's gentle enough on my newborn's skin. The colors and pattern are just gorgeous and modern, yet simple enough for a nursery. The only thing to beware of is not to wash it with items that have velcro because they tear this gentle fabric.
