I bought these cups when my daughter was 7 months old. I never read the directions came with the cup which i think many people who buy these cups do. You think you will put it together and it works. It was so hard for me to suck anything out of it and I offered them to my 6 year old nephew who once visited me. He said he didn't want them because it's hard to get liquid out. So I had them for about 6 months when i wanted to just throw them away but i decided to read positive reviews about it. It turns out you need to really push the two parts of the straw into each other. It has a part inside the softer straw that doesn't let water come through so you need to push the harder straw into the softer one to make an opening. The day I read about it and put it together my 1 year old daughter learned how to suck from it and she was so proud of herself. She drank two cups of water in just few hours. Since then we use only these cups. They are the best. They don't leak, you don't loose lids.
