Again, Phil and Ted never include instructions so its up to you to figure out the nuances of putting this thing on. At first, my toddler was a bit scared to be covered by this large black blanket like material (she sits in the front) but soon discovered she liked "hiding" behind it.  The cover is LARGE and when you no longer need it, it secures in one of the side saddle bags (another accessory) easily. Getting it on takes a few minutes so just hope you have the 3-4 minutes to snap it back on when you can. This isn't for short trips. This is better for those longer trips when you know you'll be walking around a lot with the kids (i.e. theme parks).
