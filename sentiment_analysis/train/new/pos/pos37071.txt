Read the reviews and as always you have to take many of them with a pinch of salt.  Needless to say we were in the market for a dual-sided rail set for our son.  We had removed a rather expensive queen bed for his nursery a few years ago and now he’s at the age where a  bigger size bed was needed.Rather spend on a children's bed that would require replacing in a few years we decided to give the old bed and mattress a try.  My point here is in the unusual case where these rails might be required to branch the width of a queen size bed, I can attest to the fact they will, the mattress has enough weight and height to keep the uprights in solid formation and prevent him from falling down between mattress and rail  ... for the record he now sleeps soundly for the whole night in the bed, although be it rather large for him.The bed is a low platform bed and solid wood construction, the sides rails are set to their deepest setup, one side is designed to stay in the upright position permanently, the other side (right hand side as seen in the stock photo) folds outward and down, although the platform bed prevents this from being vertically downwards.Assembly is easy and instructions are clear and simplistic in nature, time to assemble without a stop-watch or pushing the sound barrier was approximately 25 minutes.  Construction is good and solid (for cloth sided rails), this is in comparison to a single sided rail used in his cribs side off setup.After reading these reviews, purchasing this item, assembling it and for what is a little over two weeks and backed by a sense of assurance, I’m left struggling with what some of the reviewers as saying, for example “useless and unsafe”, I can see no evidence to support this in my experience and environment.  I don’t want to sound like I’m out to defend a product, but I think for the price, construction and (depending on one’s level of common sense) installation this is a very good product, in my opinion.For what it is and the price,I highly recommend this product, but please do a small amount of research before you buy.
