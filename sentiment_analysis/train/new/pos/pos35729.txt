My neighbor had these and my daughter loved them!  Now that we have our own set, she still loves them!  Every other stroller toy clips on the toy bar and hangs down, so she isn't as interested.  These stand up on the bar making the toys closer to her eye level.  I LOVE THESE!!  As for the bad reviews --- this item does not include a stroller.  It is just toys to Velcro around the belly bar of a stroller.  If you don't have a belly bar, don't get this.
