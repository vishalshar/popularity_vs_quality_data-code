I was worried about ordering this for my daughter's nursery because of the mixed reviews.  I purchased at the right moment, though, so I got this dresser for about $215 with free shipping, and I definitely think that it is worth that price.  I will clarify, though, since there is some mixed and confusing information about this product, that this dresser is NOT solid wood--it's wood and particleboard.  Think IKEA-grade furniture with worse assembly instructions.That said, this dresser is really attractive, and it's perfect for my daughter's nursery.  I believe it will grow with her, and I certainly expect it to last for several years without issue.  Design-wise, I think it looks better than a lot of IKEA dressers, so I'm happy we went this direction.  I'm not crazy about the knobs, so I'll probably replace those with something a bit more modern, but otherwise it's a nice piece of furniture and the perfect size and height to use for a changing table.
