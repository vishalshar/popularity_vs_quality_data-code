My son loves this & I love how it looks in his Nemo nursery. It plays for a very long time & transitions to it doesn't all shut off at once to wake baby up. I just wish the volume control was a little better. Also, I wish I could set it to be on with it starting the cycle. If you flip the switch, it turns on, even if I just want my son to be able to turn it on himself by hitting the fish later. Can be a distraction
