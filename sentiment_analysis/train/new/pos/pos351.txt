I added two photos, one of baby using with a Tommee Tippee using the large side; the other is how a skinny Medela bottle sits on the small opening side.My baby loves this thing, she can hold it with a bottle and makes life so much easier for everyone - I now can sometimes enjoy hot food myself! Just make sure the baby is reclined enough, she sometimes has difficulty with a full bottle in a car seat recline because the weight of the bottle 4oz or less and car seat is fine more than that and she needs a boppy recline. She also enjoys the ball as a toy as it is great for dropping on the floor to make others pick up.
