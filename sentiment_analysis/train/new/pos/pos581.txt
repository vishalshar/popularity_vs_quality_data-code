If your lil one wants some water/bath toys - get these instead of the "squirters" since those can get moldy inside!After reading a lot about bath toys and the problems (black mold!) keeping them clean, I decided to go with these.The 16 piece set is actually two of 8 different types of sea animals.  I just use 8 for now and keep the other 8 as backup in case anything happens to the others.  They stick fairly well on flat surfaces with just a bit of water, but not so great on curved surfaces.Many larger tubs/garden tubs are slightly curved - even on the "flatter" sides - and it can be a bit harder for these guys to hang on.  Either way, they'll stay up for awhile and they float around as well.
