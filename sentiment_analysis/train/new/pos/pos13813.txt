Twins equal a minimum of 16 diapers a day... That's 64 diapers (if we're lucky) between trash days. These air fresheners are a gift from the baby gods for sure. After looking online for a solution and deciding that all the advice to "bake the smell" out of our diaper pail by sitting it in the sun just wasn't going to cut it for this level of baby stink, we purchased the Arm & Hammer Nursery Fresheners at 3am moment of nasal desperation.We store our extras in the freezer in a zip lock freezer bag and they seem to keep better than simply leaving the open package in a drawer. We attach ours to the inside of our dekor lid (the inside lid facing into the bag) with a command strip. Works beautifully!
