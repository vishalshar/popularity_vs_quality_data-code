This carseat is the best available, in my opinion. This is actually our second Chicco NextFit because we loved it so much for our oldest. The seat is large and heavy, but that makes it feel durable and sturdy.Pros:Easily adjustable! Did I mention easy? And adjustable? Getting kids in and out of the seat is made much easier with the orange release button on the front of the seat. It allows you to both quickly lengthen the shoulder straps and tighten them back down. The seat can be quickly attached into the seat if your car has the clips in the fold of the chair. It fits our kids really well and we have one on the small end and one on the big end. The yellow button on top of the seat adjust the height of the headrest and shoulder straps. There is a large lever under the front side of the seat that makes it really easy to adjust the position (sitting up straight vs laying down) of the seat and the level on both sides of the seat indicates which positions are in the safe range for both forward and rear-facing positions. We have taken many long, cross-country trips with these seats and they are fantastic.Cons: Price. The weight is probably the biggest complaint, but we don't move them very often. They are large, too, so you can't fit two side-by-side in a car.Overall, this carseat was at the very top of our budget and we debated back and forth about getting it but it has been worth every penny so far. Extremely convenient, safe, and comfortable for our kids.
