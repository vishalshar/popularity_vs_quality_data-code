These are very nice training pants.  I purchased Gerber, Imse Vimse and ones by Blueberry.  I don't have a preference over the Blueberries or Imse Vimse.  These do work a little better than Gerbers trainers. (Gerbers seem to hold a small trickle, while Blueberries will temporarily hold in a full accident.)If your toddler seems to be getting the hang of training and isn't easily distracted, I would definitely recommend saving your money and skipping these.  While I found Gerbers to be perfectly adequate for my first two children, my youngest tends to be so absorbed in her play that she sometimes misses her body's cues - which is why I love having these for her.That being said, if you are looking for something that will hold in a full accident for any extended length of time - these are NOT what you are looking for. These will resist leaking long enough for you to remove them before they soak your child's clothing. (Once you see that "look" in your toddler's eye - you'll have maybe a minute or two.)They are not for bedwetting, will not keep a car seat dry, etc, etc, etc. These are for children who are beginning to show some bladder and bowel control.As for their design - they are very soft and I'd imagine are comfy. The sizing is on the small side, so do NOT size down. They hold up well in the wash. My daughter was so excited to wear these and wants them to stay dry as she loves wearing underwear.*** I did experience one thing that was unexpected with these diapers.  This is in no way a complaint of these pants and is not a complaint of the company.  It probably won't be an issue for most parents.  I purchased some of the giraffe-print trainers because they look just like my toddler's beloved Swaddlebees diaper.  Because the print matches her diaper, I cannot convince her that the matching pant is underwear.  I didn't expect that to be an issue, but I'm assuming that my daughter wouldn't be the only toddler who didn't like her new undies to match her old diapers.
