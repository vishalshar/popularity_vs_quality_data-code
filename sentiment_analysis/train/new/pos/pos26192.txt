Seat belts are made for the average man, not women and kids. I've tried all kinds of gagits trying to find something that works, is comfortable and doesn't have to be totally set up each time you use it. This is the best option I've found so far and I've tried everything I couldn't lay my hands on for years. My 10 yr old won't fool with it, but then he tries his best to get by with not using a seat belt at all. I use it and find it non binding and it doesn't wrinkle your clothes. It's padded and actually comfortable.
