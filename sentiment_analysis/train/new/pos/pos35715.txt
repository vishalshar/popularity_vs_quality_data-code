Absolutely adorable for my little one. I needed to have something to protect her clothing from art projects at daycare. She's still not 2 /"so I wanted something that she could wear now and for years to come.  I also did not want the cheap plastic because they are too hot and tear.  The bright colors are joyful. The lining is a nice feature that adds to the protection. It is definitely not plastic so it won't be waterproof but should keep normal paint dripping from seeping through.
