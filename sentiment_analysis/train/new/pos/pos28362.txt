I would highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a high capacity 9v.  The charger is a little non-intuitive, but I can work around that.  Just plug it in and unplug it 24 hours later for the batteries you receive with the charger.  Other batteries with different mAh would be different obviously.  I use these batteries for paint ball.  Normal batteries would only last me a day, maybe day and a half.  These things lasted well over two full days of paint ball.  My paint ball marker (gun) seems to hog the juice for some reason.  Great item, great price, fast shipping!T-228 Plug-in Compact Charger with 4 pcs of Tenergy 9V 250mAh NiMH Batteries
