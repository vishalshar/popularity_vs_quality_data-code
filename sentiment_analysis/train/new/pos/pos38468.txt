These mats are thick and comfortable for my baby to play on and absolutely no smell .  I was a little worried about the reviews who said they made their floors slippery and they were right. I have "wood" vinyl flooring and it was like walking on ice after having these play tiles down for less then an hour. The slipperiness even spread to the surrounding floor. My 12 year old almost fell while holding the baby.  I was so disappointed because I really loved these when I opened em.  I wiped em down with a wet paper towel before putting em down and didn't notice anything on the tiles. No powder or oil that would cause the slipperiness. I mopped the floor and it was still slippery. So I mopped again and used baking soda. That did the trick it cleaned up what ever was causing the slipperiness. I was about to package the play tiles back up to send back but my husband suggested we clean them with the baking soda too. So we sprinkled baking soda on all the tiles, both sides, and rubbed it in. Let them sit over night and cleaned em off in the morning.  Now after all that, these play tiles are great! I don't even mind the extra steps we had to take to get em usable. I'm even considering buying another set to expand the play area. My only complaint is the colors, I would have liked to have a more neutral look or at least some choice in colors.
