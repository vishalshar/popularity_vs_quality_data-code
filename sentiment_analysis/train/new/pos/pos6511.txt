People who have a problem with these disks don't seem to understand that these are designed as replacements discs that come with the Safety 1st Diaper Pail (http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Easy-Saver-Diaper/dp/B0009A4FBQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top). It's not their fault though. The picture Amazon has with the product here doesn't explain that well, so I uploaded one with my review.They are designed to go in a container in the lid. If you are like me and accidentally threw out the container after it dropped into the trash (didn't put it back on right), you can also tape it to the inside of the lid. The discs are not magic odor dissolvers (helps if you change the trash at least every other day), but the deodorizers make a big difference. When I first ran out, I tried baking soda packets, and these work much better.
