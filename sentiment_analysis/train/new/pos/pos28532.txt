A cute little turtle, plush, easy to use.  Each section of the shell plays a different note like a piano and while my 3 month old twins aren't totally on board yet I've spent more time than I care to admit figuring out how to play twinkle twinkle, etc.  I just wish it has a mode that played more music.  i.e. a piano mode and a 'hit anything and it plays a short song' mode.
