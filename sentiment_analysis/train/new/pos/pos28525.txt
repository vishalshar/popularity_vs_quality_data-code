I love the set, it included a Comforter, so it was really a great deal.  It was made by Crown Crafts with is a company that I love.  The only thing is that is it a Toddler Set so it does not fit a twin bed - My mistake, but it worked out great because she can use it at daycare.  The pillowcase and comforter were great too, she can use her comforter to  just lay around on in her room or watching tv in the living room.  We call her Pickles, so this set worked out great because it had the Lalaloopsy Pickles doll picture on it.  She loved it and has been using in all the time.  I thought the sheet sheet was so pretty with bright colors and the sheet set was bright colored stars. I would buy again, I may still get her a twin bed sheet set, but for now she can enjoy at daycare and at home.
