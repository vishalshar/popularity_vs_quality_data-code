Unlike others I've tried (i.e., Medela, which felt wonderfully soft out of the box and have been lumpy and not soft ever since the first wash), the texture of these actually stays nice.  I have put these through normal washer and dryer cycles multiple times with no problem and they come with a little wash bag.  They also have a nice smooth surface that doesn't stick to you or leave any residue.  Not too thick and very flexible so they don't show under your bra.  Only issue is that because they're not super thick they can soak through if you leak a lot.  If I know I'll be a while between feedings, I use the super absorbency ones.  They're still fine for that during the day, but have started to soak through overnight.  (Nothing to compare it to, but I would guess I'm a moderate leaker.  I've woken up to wet spots on the sheets when not using breast pads, but have never created a "lake" in the bed like I once heard a lactation consultant describe!)  Anyway, I wish they would also make these with a nighttime ("super super"?!) absorbency, but otherwise totally love them.  By the way, I had originally planned to use disposables (washing breast pads seemed like one more item on my to-do list that I wouldn't need with a newborn), but found those to be plasticy and much less comfortable, so I'd recommend reusbales that hold up well without having to be hand-washed.
