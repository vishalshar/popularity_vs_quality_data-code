I have never tried using this product for diapering, but bought them to use as burp cloths instead. I was also given "real" burp cloths at my baby shower, and I can't understand why people would pay so much for them. The "real" burp cloths are usually smaller and more expensive than this product. As burp cloths, this product is everything you need. They are big enough to throw over your shoulder without having to worry about the perfect placement to catch anything it needs to catch. There's enough material for a little extra to hang in either direction, which is especially convenient with squirmy babies. The material is soft on baby's skin (and yours), and it's thick enough in all areas so that you won't have any spit-up leaking through to your own clothes. I have not had any problems with these in the washing machine, but I prefer hanging them to dry (they seem to stay softer that way). This isn't an issue at all, because they dry VERY quickly. Overall, I completely recommend this product for use as burp cloths.
