I had bought these because I lost one of the straps for my kids high chair after washing it, so I needed a replacement. These straps are so much better than the ones that came with our high chair and they adjust to different sizes so easily and are very soft so they don't rub the kids skin and bother them. In the picture they look a little big but that's because my daughter is very petite lol. I recommend these.
