my husband bought these Nuk bottles for our 15 month old at Target, but they came with the slow/med flow. It was pouring out too slow for our daughter and she was getting frustrated. So i ordered the fast flow and they work like a charm! We are going to start weaning her off bottles at 20 minutes, however we needed a new bottle because we were sick of washing Dr Browns and their million parts!
