This play yard is pretty great thus far.  Our little guy loves it - he sleeps pretty well in the bassinet.  It's a pretty color scheme, too.  I wish that there were storage shelving under the bassinet while the play yard is not being used.  We don't really use the toys too much - they get in the way of putting baby in and taking him out of the bassinet.  I also would like it if the changing table wasn't quite so difficult to assemble and disassemble with one hand, as I'm usually holding LO when I'm going to change him.  I have to put him in the bassinet and then assemble the changing table and then put him on it.  Because of that, I usually don't even bother with it.  The storage pockets on the side are pretty okay, I put extra sheets and plastic bags for diaper disposal in them.  I wish the "mattress", which is super thin, didn't lose its shape so easily, as you can tell where LO usually sleeps.  Also I think it's kinda silly that the mattress cover is line dry only... things that are made for babies should be machine washable and machine dryable.  Overall, it functions well as a bassinet and changing table; we haven't used it as a play yard yet.
