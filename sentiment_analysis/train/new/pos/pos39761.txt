We use this bottle with pumped milk when mommy is at work.  The nipple shape promotes a nice open flanged mouth position.  It also doesn't drip much so baby has to work to get milk just like from mom.  We've had very few issues continually going back and forth with this bottle and mommy.The bottle design itself could use a little work.  As others have mentioned there is a lip where the round shape comes in at the nipple.  At least a full nipple worth of milk gets stuck there and the only way to get it to baby is to remove the bottle from their mouth, swish the bottle upside down and get it to drop into the nipple, then give it back to baby.  Sometimes you have to do this more than once, especially if you're feeding in a more upright position.  I don't like wasting precious milk so we end up doing this, but it's a little disruptive to the feeding in my opinion.The product description for this kit should also be clarified.  You end up with 2 fast nipples, 2 medium nipples, and 2 fast nipples to go with 2 small and 2 large bottles.  I was hoping I'd end up with 4 slow nipples since the smaller bottles usually ship with slow flow plus the description says you get 2 slow flow.
