My son is almost a year and I was searching for an economical, complete set of stainless (not plastic) for him. These are about as economical as you can get. The fork works, and the spoon bowl is a bit wide, but my son does okay with it.The description does not indicate it includes the plate pictured, but my set did. Also, the "orange or white" is inaccurate. That should be changed. My set is green and blue, with a blue plate. (So glad I did not get pink for my little boy.)Update: We have used these for 3 years now. I put them in the dishwasher all the time. The steel is in fine condition, the plate is used looking but fine, the handles are wearing off in such a way that it looks almost like a piece was bitten out of them, and they are discolored. I hate to throw things away that can still be used, but the utensils look like they came out of the dump. TO MAKE THEM LAST LONGER, I would suggest handwash only, as I suspect they don't take to the dishwasher well. I do not regret my purchase as it was a good buy for a very tight budget. I do regret the waste that is involved. Quality utensils last a lifetime.
