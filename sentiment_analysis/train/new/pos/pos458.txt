I have used this for just over a week, but it's crystal clear.  It has so many features.  I used the music feature today and my wife was quite surprised and happy about the feature.  The temperature alarm is nice and the noise handling seems excellent.  The lights do light up more based upon the amount of noise and it even has a mode to alarm with noise so this is a great item.There is a night light included, but that particular feature is actually a joke.  It is more of a glow than a light and so I would assume the feature did not exits.  Given all the other features and since the primary goal is that of a sound monitor, I do not consider this to be a critical issue.  Love the item3 weeks now since our little girl has been born.  I am likely the temperature reading more and more as to ensure her room temperature is not to low.  Our little one was born early, so keeping her warm has been very important and with hot days, the room temperature can vary through the day.  My wife also constantly adjusts the volume, so she has definitely found this very easy to use.  The battery life on the rechargeable batteries for the remote seem great.9/22/2013 - We have now been using this monitor for 2+ months.  We remain extremely happy with this monitor.  The lights on the monitor also indicate noise and allow my wife to use a blow dryer and visually know the baby is not crying.  The base for the remote has 2 times had the cord come out and thus the monitor stopped charging.  I am not sure if it's not tight enough in the connector or if we have bumped the cord causing this.
