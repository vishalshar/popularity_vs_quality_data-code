I bought a couple different storage boxes like this one, for our new pantry and closets after remodeing our house. This one was by far the sturdiest and looked the best. The holes for the "handles" are framed in metal, for both strength and for looks. I love the different colored stripes on the inside, the way it contrasts well with the outside color. I would highly recommend this brand if all of their storage boxes are like this one.
