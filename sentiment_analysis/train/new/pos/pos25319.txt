I bought this pillow for my daughter over a year ago after trying everything else I could find, including the seat belt snoozer (awkward velcros and doesn't really work if the booster seat has a high back).  The REST UPRIGHT PILLOW is by far the best.  It is the ONLY one that keeps her head from bopping around, or hanging painfully forward or to the sides.  My husband work in a neighboring state, so we take long road trips often, sometimes 5-7 hours drive each way twice a week.  And this pillow has saved both my daughter's neck and my heart every single time.  I don't have to look in the rear view mirror to check on her, and don't have to worry about her head snapping forward in the rare occasions that I need to hit the brake abruptly.  It is made of very soft material, and the built-in arm loop is great!  My daughter loves its color and comfortable design, and I love that it is washable.  I should note that my daughter still slumps a little bit when she rests her chin on it to sleep, but that's probably because I took out one of the foam pieces (it was too tall for her when we first got it).  Again, I have bought many many travel pillows for my daughter, and the REST UPRIGHT PILLOW is not only the best I've found, but also the only one that truly does what it's supposed to - keep kids upright and comfortable while napping in cars.  I highly recommend it.
