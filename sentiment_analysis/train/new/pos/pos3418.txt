I'm expecting twins so needed to purchase two cribs. These are perfect! The size is nice not too big like many convertible cribs that are out there now. They convert to a toddler bed. I put them together with the help of my 3 year old son in no time all. They are beautiful, sturdy, and fit great in the babies room which is not the biggest bedroom but the one we are using as it is on the main level of our house along with our bedroom and our son's bedroom. I would definitely recommend anyone expecting a little to buy this crib is they want something that is not over the top in size yet still beautiful.
