I bought these sheets for use at my baby's daycare.  They have porta-cribs that are white, with rounded slats all around and 3 inch mattresses. I believe those types of porta-cribs are pretty standard in day cares.  I am very happy with the product.  These sheets are specifically made for the 3 inch deep mattress as opposed to the much larger and deeper mattresses used in regular cribs.  The fit is perfect.  There is no looseness in the sheets, but they are not so tight as to pull up on the sides.  The sheets are also very soft.  I wash them every week and after 4 months of use there isn't a single loose thread and they've remained just as soft as before, if not gotten a little softer. But I've only washed them in cold water, to prevent shrinking.  I don't know what would happen to them if washed in hot water.  If you are sending your baby to daycare I highly recommend these sheets.
