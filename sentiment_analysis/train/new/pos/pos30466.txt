I asked for this diaper bag for Christmas 2007. I have had it for almost a year and I have to say it has held up pretty nicely. I get compliments on the "cute" bag and most people in my area do not have it. It isn't $$$ and it works for a girl or a boy. Even my husband doesn't mind the color or style. FYI:They have the same bag in a lot of other colors. The best part of this bag is that it has the clips to convert it to a stroller bag. It has lots and lots of storage space and there are times I end up losing little bags of snacks and goodies with all the inside pockets before I get a chance to clean the bag out. The canvas is sturdy and durable. I use it everyday and it looks new still. No stains and pretty easy to wipe off. My sister-in-law wants one since in the last year she has already gone through 2 diaper bags she got from the local baby mega store.
