I had heard wonderful things about Sophie and how every baby loved theirs but when I saw how much it cost I was a little taken aback. But honestly, it's the best investment I've made teething product wise. My 6 month old son hasn't paid attention to or received any relief from the traditional teething rings - frozen or otherwise - but Sophie really seems to soothe him. He chews on her ears, her hoofs and she's really easy to hold.The Chan Blue is just OK in my opinion. I wanted the blue one thinking it would be neat for my son and while he does use it, I feel like it doesn't have as many good places to chew on if you will. It's also very squeaky. Both items are squeaky but with Sophie you have to grab it in just the right place to whereas the Chan Blue squeaks just by touching him.Overall I'm very happy with both but if I had to do over again, I probably would get a Sophie or 2 Sophies so I could have a backup.
