I got this car seat toy for my son the other day. He really seems to like it. I tried the car seat activity center by Lamaze and that was a waste of money. It fell apart right after I got it. This one has a lot more activities and sounds and a night light for night time driving. I am very pleased with this toy. Sassy always makes good products!
