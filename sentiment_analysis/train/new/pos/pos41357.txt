This has been one of the best items we've purchased for our baby! Our daughter is turning 5 months and wants to be in the mix. Usually I prop her up in my lap when we are eating or sitting around the living room. This little chair has improved her ability to sit up on her own and allows her to get a good view of what is going on. Better for us-- it is light and easy to move around the house. The insert is removable for when she gets bigger and is very easy to clean. At this point she is able to pop off the tray, but that is not a deal-breaker for me since we use the tray to hold her toys. The design of her seat keeps her in and prevents her from falling out. We had previously looked at several different options but am so glad we went with the Baby Snug!
