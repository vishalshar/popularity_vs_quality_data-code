This is just what I needed to hold the breast milk I pumped at work. I am able to fit 2 Medela - 10 oz bottles in the bag with some room to spare. I have included photos to show how much room is left after bottles are put in. I love the little ice pack although I do use a gel ice pack in there for additional cooling as I don't feel it completely keeps it as cold as I'd like throughout the day.I put this cooler in this adorable tote that holds my pump as well and all misc parts.

Wonderful purchase and I also appreciate that I can put the 10 oz bottles in there.
