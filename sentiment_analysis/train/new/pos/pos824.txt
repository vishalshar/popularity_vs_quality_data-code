I have an odd sized entry way and I like to keep my dogs away from my storm door as it is all glass. I also like to answer the door and use the door without them trying to escape or jump on people entering my home. This fits the bill perfectly! It was super easy to install and works great. It is not of the highest/strongest construction due to it's purpose and placement and short of this being made of titanium I won't find a better gate for this purpose. My dogs do not charge or jump on baby gates so this is extremely helpful for me. It swings both ways, can collapse to it's shortest width and can easily be remove from the wall brackets. I really love it.
