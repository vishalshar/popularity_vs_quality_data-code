She can't quite hold him by herself,  but she loves to follow him with her eyes when I play with him in front of her.  The colors are great & I think she will love to twist his nubs around when she is a little older.  It's probably a decent teether for older babies.. it's head is soft & the hard nubs have different textures.  My daughter is teething at 2mths so he is too big for her to teeth on right now.. but it's still great as a bright colored twisty toy.
