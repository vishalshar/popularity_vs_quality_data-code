Normally I would not give five stars when what I received was not what was advertised. However, what I received were he updated CLEAR valves that my pump accessories actually came with. I was nervous seeing as the picture shows white valves. When the package came I was DELIGHTEDLY that they were the true Ameda CLEAR valves that I actually wanted. I hope this review helps you and makes you want to purchase this product because I was skeptical, but am extremely happy with what I received. Also, many of the Q and A talk about a specific Ameda pump. It doesn't matter which Ameda model you have, the valves are universal in the Ameda world. That was another thing I was worried about but was happy that Ameda valves and probably accessories all seem to be the same. If you find this review helpful please mark it so! Thank you :)
