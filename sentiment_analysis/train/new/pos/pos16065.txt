Having the ability to pump on the way to work lets me sleep in for an additional 1/2 hour (I EP). That sleep has made such a difference that I'm buying a second one to have as a back-up just in case. The only negative is that the suction is not as much as the regular plug-in adapter, but since I never use my PISA  on full suction it doesn't matter. Do make sure you are buying the right one -- check the faceplate of your PISA to make sure it takes the 9 volt adapter.
