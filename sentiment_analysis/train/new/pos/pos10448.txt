Facing baby while she was a newborn was essential for me. At about 2.5 months she got sick of looking at my all day so we switched the the seat the navigator came with. We still use this seat as a chair for her now at 5.5 months. I use it in the yard or living room. It is light weight and easy to move but does have a vary wide base so it can be tricky to set on a table.I'd read some reviews that people's children grew out of it but even at roughly 27 inches my babe fits.
