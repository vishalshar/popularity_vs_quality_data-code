At first my son was terrified of this thing when he was about 1 year old. Now at 20 months he likes it a lot (as does my 3.5-year-old). Unfortunately this thing sucks up batteries really fast. You can tell when the batteries are dying because the fountain of water doesn't shoot out as high. Also, this is our second one because the first one broke (water got into the battery casing). Overall I love this thing because it's a neat bath toy but I wish it were more durable.
