I'm giving these 5 stars....not because they're as good quality as the ones I used on my kids in the 80's, but because, as a grandma now in 2011, I was surprised to be able to buy any at ALL lol (most people who use cloth diapers now seem to use those very expensive "designer" nappies with velcro) and, with that in mind, they were better quality than I expected to find for a product I thought was obsolete.True, the safety lock is not as good as the ones of long ago, but is better than a regular safety pin and seems to be good enough until my granddaughter is potty-trained.  Note about tip sharpness of these pins:  I'm using homemade prefolds & birdsey diapers I made from my old flannel sheets, and that may be harder on the pins than the prefolds & birdseyes you buy....a couple of times the pins became difficult to push through (after many times of pushing through) but if the pin becomes dull or the tip gets bent, you can fix that by sharpening them on an emery board/nail file...i'd sharpen the pin, putting the tip on the file and running it downwards, turning the pin and filing more, checking visually by holding the pin in front of the t.v. and gently poking my finger on the sharp tip to know when it was sharp enough.
