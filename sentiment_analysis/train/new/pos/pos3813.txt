This item is a 2-pack of manual diaphrams with the stem that works on the manual Avent Isis pumps. I have the Isis Duo electric pump, which has the parts to make one of the heads manual, which is so convenient. However, the pump kit comes with only one of these stemmed diaphrams, however I pump twice a day at work using the manual attachment and dont want to wash it so I needed more. They are impossible to find in stores. Good job Amazon for having them in stock!
