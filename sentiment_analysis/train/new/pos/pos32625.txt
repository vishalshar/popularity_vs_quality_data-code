I am a believer that if a child can take a sippy cup they are done with bottles. My two older children were able to take a cup at 5-6 months. Now with the third child I expected the same thing. She was a bit more stubborn! I have bought every cup imaginable. Ranging in price up to $15.00 in search of a cup she would take. After reading A TON of reviews on every single cup I bought this one. She took it immediately. She has been taking only this cup for 3 days and I have sacked up the bottles...we are done :) I just ordered 2 more. Hopefully after some time she will take other sippy cups as well so I will get my monies worth out of all of the cups.My List Of Loves:I love that it is easy to clean. I simply rinse it out and squeeze the end of the straw while water flows over the weighted part to clean out the straw.It has a flip lid to keep it clean.Handles on the side that do not move when she is holding it.Fits in cup holders.Does a good job of not pouring liquid out when she throws it on the ground.Has ounces on it.The flow is the perfect flow for her...not too fast like other straw cups we tried.The weighted straw is the best part. It works great!
