Bought this 6 years ago during my first pregnancy and never got around to buying a cover for it. No worries; any handy blanket will do when you sit to nurse baby. I'm on my fourth baby and this pillow is still as good as new. I've thrown it in the washer/dryer a hundred times and it's maintained its color/shape. This pillow is not just a handy breastfeeding/bottle feeding tool either; it helps keep baby positioned safely if he/she falls asleep in the middle of your big bed and you don't want to move him/her. It props them up later when they are learning to lift their head. It can be used as extra padding/protection against the wall or bed rail when baby is a toddler. It's a back prop if Mommy's back hurts and she needs extra support. And now that my girls are sharing a Queen bed, it help provide a soft barrier between them so the younger one doesn't kick her sister all night. Do yourself a favor and whether you plan to breast/bottle feed it doesn't matter; this is a very versatile, helpful baby purchase that you will literally get YEARS of use out of. I can't say the same for the changing table, diaper pail, and other baby purchases that I just used for a few months, but I'll save those comments for other reviews!
