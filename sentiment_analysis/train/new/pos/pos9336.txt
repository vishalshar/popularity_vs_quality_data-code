Love this play yard!  It's a great size, I feel like little man has much more room to crawl around and have toys in there as compared to a standard sleeping pack n play.  The colors are great and the characters on the sides are very cheerful.  Little man doesn't mind being in there most times and it's nice to have him somewhere safe while I'm getting household tasks done.Initial setup was easy, except the pushing of the floor down was tough.  not sure if that was just because it was the first use or if I was doing something wrong... or if I just  hadn't eaten my Wheaties that day!  I haven't had to pack it up yet, so if the setup doesn't get easier, I might dock a star from the rating.  It isn't light, but it's manageable.
