We're trying to fix up my one-year-old's sleep.  She didn't have a lovey, and we needed to ditch her pacifier.  She loves, loves, loves her Twilight Turtle ("turtle" and "star" were among her first words thanks to that), so I decided to get some more "huggable" turtles to use as loveys.  I got this rattle one, a small keychain turtle, and a larger pillow turtle (all Cloud b products in the Twilight Turtle family).  Well, the pillow was too big for a lovey, the keychain turtle too small, and while this guy was a little smaller than I would have liked, it still makes a great lovey.  It's soft, she can shake it and the sound can comfort her in the dark when she can't see, and it's just big enough that it doesn't immediately fall through the crib bars.  Wish it were just a little larger, but for the price you won't hear me complain.
