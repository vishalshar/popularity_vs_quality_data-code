We've tried dozens of bibs over the years and the Bumkins are our all time favorites.  All of the Bumkins bibs I have tried have been easy to care for and have held up well over time. I particularly like the Junior Bib and the Short Sleeve Art Smock-they fully cover both baby's chest and baby's lap and the sleeves help keep baby from pulling the bib off.Starter Bib:  This is a nice enough bib but it's so small that it's not useful for long at least with the way my kids eat (not only do they get plenty of food on their chests but they also drop tons of food down into their lap which this bib doesn't catch even with the pocket).  The bib is 8 inches across and 6.5 inches long.  My kids also quickly learned how to pull this bib off by reaching back and undoing the velcro.Super Bib:  This is a bigger version of the started bib at 10 inches across and 9 inches down.  It works better than the starter bib but still doesn't totally cover baby's lap and can be pulled off relatively easily.Supersized Super Bib:  This is roughly 18 inches across and 18 inches down.  It does a good job of completely covering baby's lap but it's oddly shaped and tapers in in the middle which means it doesn't really cover the sides of their torso.  It's also easy to pull off.Bumkins Junior Bib: This measures 14.5 across (not counting the sleeves) and 14 inch down.  It does a good job of fully covering babies/toddlers and the sleeves mean they can't just reach up and pull it off.Bumkins Short Sleeved Art Smock:  This is basically a bigger version of the junior bib.  It measures 17 across and 20 inches long making it a great choice for older toddlers/preschoolers.  Again the sleeves mean you can't just reach up and pull it off.  It also has a tie around the waist to hold it in place.
