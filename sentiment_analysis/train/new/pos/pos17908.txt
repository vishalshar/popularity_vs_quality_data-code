very cute and matched forest themed room perfectly...i made the mistake of buying this hamper made for a babies room for my 5 and 6 year olds forest theme room and they split the wood in half and ripped the cover within six months of me buying it so if your looking at this for a nursery i say yes go for it ...if your looking for it to withstand two young children...its a no.
