I PURCHASED 4 OF THESE 6 MONTHS AGO AND THEY WORK GREAT. I BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE MY BABY KEPT  HITTING HER MOUTH AND HEAD ON THE TOP RAIL WHEN SHE WAS STANDING UP. HOWEVER THIS WOULD WORK WELL FOR KIDS THAT ARE BITING THE RAIL TOO. THEY ARE PADDED AND SOFT. I HAVE A PORTABLE CRIB WHICH IS SMALLER THAN A STANDARD CRIB SO I CUT 2 OF THEM IN HALF AND QUICKLY HAND SOWED THE EDGE TO COVER THE SIDE RAIL. FOR THE FRONT RAIL, I JUST FOLDED THE SIDES UNDER A LITTLE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO LONG. THEY WORK GREAT AND THE CREAM COLR MATCHES WITH A LOT OF COLORS. THEY LOOK NICE ON THE CRIB. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS BECAUSE THE HOLES THAT YOU PUT THE STRING THROUGH TO LACE IT ON THE RAIL DO NOT HAVE A DOUBLE SEEM AROUND THE HOLE SO THEY EASILY RIP IF YOU PULL TOO TIGHT. IF THAT DETAIL WOULD'VE BEEN SOWN TO BE MORE DURABLE, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS. ALSO, I HAD TO CALL THE COMPANY FOR DETAILS AND MEASUREMENTS, AND THE COSTUMER SERVICE WAS GOOD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE A LITTLE PRICEY. IT IS TRUE THAT IT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME AND WORK TO TREAD THE STRINGS THAT TIE THE CUSHION ONTO THE RAIL, BUT ONCE IT IS ON, IT SURE IS TIGHT,
