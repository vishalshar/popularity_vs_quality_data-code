This is a great car seat! It fit my HUGE baby and still does at 8 months (he is now 24.5 lbs and 30 inches long)! I am impressed at the size of the car seat itself. It was a full 8 inches SHORTER than the graco safeseat. I am very pleased with the performance and it is SUPER easy to use. This is great for someone with a small car and needs a means to fit a baby rear-facing along with a toddler front facing and 2 adults! This is a definite!
