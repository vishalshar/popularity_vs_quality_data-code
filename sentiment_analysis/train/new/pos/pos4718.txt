When my son started gnawing on the straps to my Ergo, I knew I needed to get something to protect them quickly! I ordered the organic pads because I liked the idea of snaps versus velcro and I know how soft my organic carrier is and I wanted my teething pads to be just as soft. These do not disappoint. They're very soft and my son loves chewing on them! Great to save the straps of your Ergo. Instead of constantly washing the carrier, you just throw the pads in the wash and dryer and you're ready to go! Would definitely recommend these. They cost a little bit more but I feel the organic cotton is worth it!
