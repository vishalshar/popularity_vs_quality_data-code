I bought three of these, in addition to some other stickers, and ended up just using these. I went all the way around the room of my twin boys. It looks great! They didn't take long to put up at all. I did mark a line around the entire room as a guide; however, the road that I built often deviated from that line. My only complaint was that there was no diversity in the little faces of the people driving the various vehicles. I want my little black twins to see smiling faces on the wall that are their color as well!They've now been up almost 2 years & I haven't had any fall off or even peel a little.  Very durable.
