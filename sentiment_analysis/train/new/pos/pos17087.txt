A lifesaver - my son started using it as a lovey to twiddle on since he was 2 months old. He is over 20 months now and he is still very much into it. I also recommend it as something for the busy hands to do during breastfeeding (he did not like nursing necklace). He is playing with the blanket - my first son used to play with my hair and touch my face which was driving me nuts. I bought another set to use as replacements. the original set is a great shape, but sometime I cannot keep up with laundering them on time.
