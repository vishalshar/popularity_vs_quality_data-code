We ordered the joovy groove right before a week long trip to Hawaii, and both baby and parents loved it.  Our other stroller is a Bob, and we didn't want to lug that large of a stroller on our trip.  It maneuvers very well one handed (I easily pulled a suitcase behind me while pushing the stroller), and the nice canopy kept our 6 month old well shaded throughout the day.  With the canopy open and locked in place, you can also hang a decent sized bag from the handles.  I really appreciated the reclining feature for naps and easy diaper changes!  The brakes and wheels worked really well, and while the underseat basket isn't huge (remember it's an umbrella stroller), it's definitely adequate and I often fit my diaper bag and a blanket down there.  The cup holders are loose mesh, but deep enough to hold a 16 oz. smoothie or iced coffee.  The only negative I experienced on our trip was that the stroller didn't work well on sand.  But, what umbrella stroller, with these same features, does work on sand?  While I did have an issue with our first stroller that was sent out, Joovy has excellent customer service and both Dave and Caesar went out of their way to take care of us and quickly sent a replacement in time for our trip. Thank you, Joovy!
