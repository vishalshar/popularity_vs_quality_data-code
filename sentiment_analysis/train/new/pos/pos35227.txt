This is our second Flensted mobile. This one resided over the changing table at first. We kept it low enough so our son could see it and the high contrast is great. He started noticing it around 6 weeks. He is absolutely mesmerized by the ladybugs. They are large and easy for him to focus on. The subtle, balanced movement allows him to track easily instead of overwhelming, fast movement. This has been such a huge help as he's become much more active, now around 4 months. He laughs and ponders his ladybugs, keeping him entertained for awhile. We actually moved it over the crib so he had a safe, fun place to hang out while I put in a load of laundry or ate lunch quickly. This is a more delicate mobile so it needs to stay out of reach of curious hands. We just kept the full length of string so we can raise or lower as necessary. A simple eye hook in the ceiling is all you need. A wonderful purchase and great gift.
