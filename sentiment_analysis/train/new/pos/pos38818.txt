I bought this set mainly for the spout cover, which has served well at protecting my son, even though the feet are a great place for yucky black tub slime to grow.  I also positioned the mesh toy holder on the wall to where the feet would cover the shiny hot and cold knobs that seem so attractive to little kids!  The problem I found with the toy caddy is that I never once used it to hold toys.  It's pretty small - and flat.  Most toys I give my toddler for the tub are neither small nor flat.  Otherwise, this is a super cute set, and even with it's faults, it was a help, and it brightened up the bathroom with big smiles and bright colors.
