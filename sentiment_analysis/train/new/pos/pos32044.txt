?The KidCo blender is extremely handy for pur=eing meals for my husband who had a stroke and has difficulty swallowing regular foods.  It does a great job with everything from pizza (with added tomato juice or salsa) to mac and cheese (with added milk).  Of interest, the pureed foods condense to a much smaller volume than if eaten intact, except for the foods to which Ione needs to add liquids (pizza, mac and cheese).  I use it for all three meals for several foods at each meal.  So glad I have it!
