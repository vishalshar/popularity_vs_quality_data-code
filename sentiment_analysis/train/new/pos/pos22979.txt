We bought this for our newborn son. There isn't a volume adjuster and the volume is quite loud, and seemed to scare him. However, when he got to be about 4 months old he was pulling on some of the toys and getting them to light up and make music, which seemed to "engage him."Another downside other than the loud volume, is the narrow space in between for the infant to lay. When our son started to roll, he would roll into it and "get stuck" and scream till we moved it away from him so he could roll all the way over.
