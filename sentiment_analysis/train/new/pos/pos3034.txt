I purchased these to replace a rubber duck made of PVC plastic. I searched high and low for bath toys (particularly a rubber duck) that were not made of plastic and did not have squeakers or squirt holes that would become a breeding ground for mold/mildew. In the end I found two options that fit my requirements, this natural rubber bath toy set made by Hevea and a silicone "scrubber ducky" made by Fred and Friends (which I also bought).These bath toys are a great option if you are trying to cut back on conventional (petroleum based) plastic. They are composed of 100% natural rubber (latex) from the Hevea tree and are naturally colored. I like that there are no questionable dyes, paints or additives to worry about in these. We have had these bath toys for over a year and they are very loved. My two children don't seem to mind at all that they aren't as colorful as some of their other bath toys.I highly recommend this set...the only downside for me is the expensive price tag. I really wish they were more affordable! Since they are latex however you may want to exercise caution when giving them to any child who may have a latex allergy. Hevea (the manufacturer) says that the chance of an allergic reaction to their products is extremely low since during the processing of their material much of the latex protein that causes allergic reactions is leeched out.  They claim that no reports of negative reactions have been reported.I hope this helps you out!
