Update: 12/9/14I installed these door locks in Sept. When our twins could reach the door levers. We have 4 doors they are accessible to so we installed these on all 4 doors. They worked awesome, easy to install and everyone who visited could figure them out easily. 3 months later when our twins hit about 18 months they figured out how to get them open from pulling the inside of the door lock down to release the lock. We're now looking into top door lock that I wish I would have done from the get go but was trying to avoid screwing into the door jam. I had to drop it a star because it only worked for a short time.A friend of mine recommended these to me as another model was known to lock you out from the other side.These are very easy to install and figure out for guests and it keeps the little ones out of the rooms they are not supposed to be in.
