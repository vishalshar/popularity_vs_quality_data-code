I absolutely LOVE these boosters. I use Blueberry simplex diapers on my son and he is a heavy wetter because he pees through everything else.  l love the ease of use of the one size all in one simplexes, but even though they have a lot of layers of cotton, they aren't enough to keep him from leaking.  So I have one of these in each one of my blueberry simplexes.  I've read on other websites that each one of these can absorb up to 3 ounces of liquid, which is great for us! I put one in his diapers and we're good to go, he even naps in these.  The stay dry top is just a layer of fleece, which makes it soft and feels dry to the touch. Get these, they are amazing!
