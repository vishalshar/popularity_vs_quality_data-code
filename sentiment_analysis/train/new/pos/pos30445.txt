We love these spoons. They are shallow and we prefer them that way. I get more food in his mouth with these than the deeper spoons that I tried. The only reason I only gave 4 stars is I thought that it was misleading to say "assorted colors" in the description but it only shows the gender neutral set in the photos. I thought "assorted colors" was referring to the fact the spoons are all the different colors shown but they really mean you might get the set shown or the "girl" set. We got a set of pink and purple spoons for my son. They work fine and I'm not weird about that kind of stuff but it would have been nice to know that it was possible we would get pink spoons. That's all. Also, I tried taking the silicone off of one of the spoons to use it for a project and that stuff is on there good! I have no fears about the silicone breaking down and coming off in my baby's mouth.
