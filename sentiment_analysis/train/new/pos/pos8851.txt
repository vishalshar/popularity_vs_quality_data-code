My 4 month old daughter kept getting her arms stuck in the bars of her crib and so, although I am scared of bumpers because of the suffocation risks, I decided that a mesh bumper would have to go into the crib. I went to target and walmart and looked at their selections and the had ugly solid mesh bumpers that would work but I thought their might be a better selection online. After debating which one to get I got this one and I am so glad that I did. The dark purple trim is silky and the velcro attachment is awesome. It has cute little dark purple flowers on it as well instead of a solid color which I liked. All of that is well and good but the best thing is that this is not the ugly mesh you find in the ones at target. It is a soft mesh and cushioned. I was afraid at first that it really wasn't as breathable as the packaging let one with it being thicker and soft so I put it against my face pretty tightly to mimic a baby snuggling close and I could breath just fine. I love this! very well made and high quality materials. Very happy and definitely would recommend to everyone.
