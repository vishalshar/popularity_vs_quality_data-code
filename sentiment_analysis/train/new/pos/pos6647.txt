This came so quickly it was unbelievable, and it is absolutely wonderful for my newborn granddaughter.  It is not designed to be a "baby tote"...so do not think you will be able to use it for that.  But if you need a portable place to have for baby to sleep near you at home or away from home...this is the thing you need for a beautiful little girl.
