I researched this motorized and lighted mobile based on other customer reviews, and I have to agree 100%.  We used it every night for about 3 months on one set of batteries.  No mechanical problems at all and our baby loved it.  She's a bit older now, so we don't need it every night, but I can't get over the efficiency with batteries.  This is a very cool mobile.  Music plays at multiple volumes (you set it), the thing rotates, and the little bugs and top of it fade on and off via LEDs.
