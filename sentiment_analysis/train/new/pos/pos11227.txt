My daughter loves this toy. The bird at the top flutters on when the baby kicks the bars. The music and chirping sounds are both quite nice. The toys that come with it to hang from the bars are very nice too. I like that the toy hangers are kind of horseshoe-shaped, so that if baby pulls hard enough the toy will come off the bars and she can play with it. We've taken a couple of them and put them on the carseat.My 3 y.o. old plays roughly with it, and so far it has held up!
