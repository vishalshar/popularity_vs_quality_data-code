I've read some of the other reviews and have not had the same issues with damage or collapsing parts. In our house, this hamper is under pretty heavy use.  I love being able to take out the mesh bag and wash it with the clothes. It holds about a week's worth of baby laundry.  I wash the printed laundry bag about once a month.  I love that the patterned piece uses thick strips of velcro to attach to the wooden frame.  It's easy to remove and replace.We bought it for the Dr Seuss-themed nursery, but it's wound up next to the changing table in the family room. It works perfect for our little one, but perhaps it would be a problem with older children.  It's sturdy enough to hold the laundry but it's definitely not built for climbing.I'd give it a 5-star review, but I think it's priced a little high for the function and materials provided.
