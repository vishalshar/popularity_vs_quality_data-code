I just love this so much! It was a lot bigger than I expected and it is just so perfect! The Nojo Jungle Tales bedding sets were so expensive so I bought the Soho Forest Buddy bedding instead--13 pieces set for $50 by the way-- (and isn't really forest critters, it's jungle) but I bought this lamp to go with it and it just goes perfectly! The lamp was bigger than expected, looks handpainted, and was totally worth the $43 I paid for it! It is just beautiful!
